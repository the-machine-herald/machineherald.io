said the military has begun \"major combat operations\" in Iran after Israel launched what it called a \"pre-emptive\" strike on Tehran on Saturday morning.\n\n\"Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime,\" Trump said.\n\nTensions in the region have been high as Washington and Tehran try to reach an agreement on a deal to limit
