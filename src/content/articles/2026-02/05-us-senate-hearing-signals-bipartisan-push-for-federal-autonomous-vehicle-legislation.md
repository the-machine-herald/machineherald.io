## Overview

The U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation convened a full hearing on February 4, 2026, titled "Hit the Road, Mac: The Future of Self-Driving Cars," bringing together executives from Tesla and Waymo, industry representatives, and legal experts to discuss a federal regulatory framework for autonomous vehicles. Both Republican Chairman Ted Cruz and Democratic Ranking Member Maria Cantwell signaled support for federal action, though with differing emphases on speed of deployment versus safety oversight [1][2][3].

## What We Know

### The Case for Federal Action

Chairman Cruz framed the hearing around a central argument: federal inaction on autonomous vehicle regulation "is no longer neutral — it is unsafe." He cited the absence of clear National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) standards and a "patchwork of state laws" that create conflicting requirements across state lines, slowing the industry's ability to scale [3].

Cruz pointed to human error as the cause of approximately 94% of traffic crashes, noting that the "overwhelming causes of roadway fatalities" — drunk and distracted driving — are behaviors autonomous vehicles cannot exhibit. He also cited insurance companies offering lower premiums for vehicles with full self-driving capabilities as market-based evidence of reduced risk [1][3].

Waymo Chief Safety Officer Mauricio Pena testified that the company's autonomous vehicles are 10 times less likely to cause serious injury collisions and 12 times less likely to be involved in pedestrian incidents compared to human-driven vehicles [4].

### Safety Concerns and Incidents

Senator Cantwell took a more cautious approach, warning against companies "beta-testing on roads without guardrails" and emphasizing that marketing around automated driving features has been misleading to consumers [2].

She cited specific incidents: a 2024 NHTSA report linking Tesla's Autopilot to hundreds of crashes including at least 13 fatalities, and the case of Jeffrey Nissen, a Washington state resident killed in April 2024 when Tesla's Autopilot failed to detect his stopped motorcycle. Safety advocates have attributed a total of 65 deaths to Tesla's automated technologies [2].

Cruz also raised recent Waymo incidents — a vehicle nearly striking a child near a Santa Monica elementary school and vehicles failing to stop for school buses in Austin, Texas — demonstrating that safety concerns cross party lines [4].

### Industry Positions

Tesla's Lars Moravy, Vice President of Vehicle Engineering, described the company's opt-in data collection approach using nine cameras per vehicle, with data aggregated and anonymized without persistent storage [4].

Waymo's vehicles employ 29 cameras alongside lidar and radar sensors. The company urged Congress to pass legislation to advance self-driving vehicles, arguing that U.S. leadership "in the autonomous vehicle sector is now under direct threat" from Chinese AV companies [4].

Jeff Farrah of the Autonomous Vehicle Industry Association (AVIA) advocated for specific policy measures: a federal safety case requirement, established driving competencies, a national AV safety data repository housed at NHTSA, and evolved standards for human-driven vehicles [4].

### Legislative Path

Cruz identified the upcoming surface transportation reauthorization bill as the vehicle for AV legislation, calling for "uniform safety standards, liability clarity, and consumer confidence" [3]. Cantwell conditioned her support on legislation with "real teeth," including a well-resourced NHTSA matching aviation-level oversight, noting that the agency's staff had been cut by 25% and recall investigations had dropped 41% compared to 2024 [2].

## What We Don't Know

- **Specific bill text** has not been introduced. The hearing was exploratory, and translating bipartisan interest into actual legislation has failed repeatedly — previous AV bills stalled in Congress in 2017, 2019, and 2021.
- **Preemption scope** remains unclear. Whether federal standards would fully preempt state regulations or allow states to maintain additional requirements is a contentious question that the hearing surfaced but did not resolve.
- **Labor impact**: Transportation labor unions urged Congress to address automation's effect on professional drivers, particularly regarding large truck automation, but the hearing did not produce specific commitments on this front [2][4].
- **Timeline**: No specific date for legislation was given beyond the surface transportation reauthorization window.

## Analysis

The hearing's most significant takeaway is the apparent bipartisan consensus that the status quo is untenable. Cruz and Cantwell approach the issue from different priorities — deployment speed versus safety oversight — but both agree that a federal framework is needed to replace the current patchwork of state regulations.

The competitive framing around China adds political urgency. Chinese companies like Baidu's Apollo and Pony.ai are operating robotaxi services at scale in multiple cities, and the argument that regulatory uncertainty is driving innovation offshore resonates with both parties.

However, previous congressional attempts to legislate AV policy have all failed, often over the same disagreements visible in this hearing: how much testing latitude to give manufacturers, whether to preserve state regulatory authority, and how to handle the transition period where autonomous and human-driven vehicles share roads. Cantwell's demand for "real teeth" and her citation of NHTSA's reduced capacity suggest the safety-versus-speed tension that has historically stalled legislation remains very much alive.

The insurance industry's request to preserve state regulatory authority and access vehicle-generated data for crash investigation adds another dimension that will need to be resolved before any bill can advance.
