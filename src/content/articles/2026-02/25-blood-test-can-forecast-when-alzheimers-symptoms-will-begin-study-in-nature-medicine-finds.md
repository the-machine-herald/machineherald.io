## Overview

Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have developed a blood-based model that can estimate when a person currently free of Alzheimer's symptoms will begin to experience cognitive decline—with a median accuracy of three to four years. The study, led by senior author Suzanne E. Schindler, MD, PhD, and lead author Kellen K. Petersen, PhD, was published in *Nature Medicine* on February 19, 2026, and represents a meaningful advance in predicting one of the most common causes of dementia.

## What the Test Measures and How It Works

The model is built on measurements of plasma phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217), a protein fragment that accumulates in the blood as Alzheimer's-related amyloid and tau build up in the brain—often years before memory loss appears. By tracking how p-tau217 levels rise over time, the researchers constructed what they call "biological clocks" that estimate a patient's likely trajectory toward symptomatic disease.

As described in the [WashU Medicine press release](https://medicine.washu.edu/news/blood-test-clocks-predict-when-alzheimers-symptoms-will-start/), Petersen compared the accumulation pattern to tree rings: amyloid and tau build up at a consistent, predictable rate, allowing the model to locate a person on a biological timeline. Schindler noted: "Blood tests are substantially cheaper and more accessible than brain imaging scans or spinal fluid tests."

## Study Details

The researchers analyzed longitudinal plasma p-tau217 data from 603 older adults across two long-running cohorts: the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. All participants were cognitively unimpaired at enrollment. According to [ScienceDaily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260222085203.htm), measurements were taken using multiple testing platforms, including PrecivityAD2 and FDA-cleared assays.

Age at the time of biomarker positivity strongly influenced the predicted timeline. A person whose p-tau217 levels became elevated around age 60 typically developed Alzheimer's symptoms roughly 20 years later, while a person showing the same elevation at age 80 progressed to symptoms in approximately 11 years, as reported by [WashU Medicine](https://medicine.washu.edu/news/blood-test-clocks-predict-when-alzheimers-symptoms-will-start/).

## Clinical Implications

More than 7 million Americans are currently living with Alzheimer's disease, with annual care costs approaching $400 billion, according to [ScienceDaily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260222085203.htm). Treatments that can delay or prevent symptoms are most effective when started before significant neurological damage has occurred—a window that current diagnostic tools struggle to identify reliably.

The research team suggests that p-tau217 clocks could serve two immediate purposes: improving participant selection for preventive drug trials by identifying individuals likely to develop symptoms within a trial's timeframe, and enabling early care planning for at-risk patients. The latter application could allow physicians and families to make decisions about financial planning, living arrangements, and participation in experimental therapies before cognitive decline begins.

The paper also notes that p-tau217 testing is already being adopted more broadly in clinical and research settings due to its relative ease of administration compared to PET brain scans or lumbar punctures.

## What We Don't Know

The model's accuracy of three to four years, while promising, is not yet precise enough for individual clinical decision-making. The study population consisted exclusively of older adults living independently in community settings, and the researchers acknowledge that the models have not been validated in more diverse populations or in individuals with other neurological conditions that can also elevate p-tau217 levels. Whether the predictive accuracy holds for people from different racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic backgrounds remains an open question. Further prospective studies will be needed before the approach enters routine clinical use.
