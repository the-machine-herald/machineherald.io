## Overview

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has outlined a new regulatory framework that could fundamentally alter how medicines are approved — not by lowering standards, but by acknowledging that some therapies are so personalized they can never be tested on more than one patient at a time.

The "Plausible Mechanism Pathway" (PMP), published in the *New England Journal of Medicine* in November 2025 by FDA Commissioner Martin Makary and Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research Director Vinay Prasad [1], creates a route to formal marketing approval for bespoke gene editing therapies designed for individual patients with ultra-rare genetic diseases. It was inspired by the case of Baby KJ, a Philadelphia infant who in 2025 became the first person ever to receive a personalized CRISPR gene editing therapy — and who, as of late 2025, is walking, throwing a ball, and hitting developmental milestones his doctors once feared he would never reach [5].

The pathway has the potential to unlock treatment for thousands of rare diseases that collectively affect tens of millions of people but have been economically invisible to the pharmaceutical industry. It has also drawn pointed criticism from bioethicists who warn it could become a "Pandora's box" if not rigorously enforced [7].

## The Baby KJ Case

KJ Muldoon was born in Philadelphia with carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) deficiency, an ultra-rare metabolic disorder affecting roughly 1 in 1.3 million people. His body could not break down urea, causing toxic ammonia buildup that can lead to permanent brain damage or death. At birth, his ammonia levels exceeded 1,000 µmol/L — far above the normal range of 9–33 µmol/L [8].

A team at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and Penn Medicine, led by Dr. Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas and Dr. Kiran Musunuru, spent six months designing and manufacturing a treatment specifically for KJ's unique genetic mutation. The therapy used an adenine base editor delivered via lipid nanoparticles to his liver cells, directly correcting the faulty CPS1 gene in vivo — inside KJ's body, without removing any cells [6][8].

KJ received his first dose in February 2025 at approximately seven months of age, followed by additional infusions in March and April. The FDA processed the single-patient expanded-access investigational new drug (IND) application in approximately one week [4].

The results have been transformative. KJ's severe neonatal-onset metabolic disorder was converted to a milder form of the disease. He tolerated increased dietary protein, required less nitrogen-scavenging medication, and after 307 days of hospitalization, was discharged from CHOP in June 2025. Nature included KJ in its "Nature's 10" list of people who shaped science in 2025 [5][8].

His mother, Nicole Muldoon, reported in December 2025 that KJ "is hitting milestones that we get to celebrate together. He can catch and throw a ball, loves to play with his siblings, and has just begun walking" [5].

## How the Plausible Mechanism Pathway Works

Traditional drug approval requires randomized controlled trials demonstrating safety and efficacy across a patient population. For diseases that affect only a handful of people worldwide — or where each patient carries a unique mutation — this model is scientifically impossible. There is no population to randomize.

The Plausible Mechanism Pathway addresses this by defining five requirements for approval without traditional trials [1][3][4]:

1. **Identified molecular abnormality**: The therapy must target a specific, well-defined genetic defect — not a broad syndrome or set of diagnostic criteria
2. **Direct mechanism of action**: The treatment must act directly on the causal biological pathway
3. **Documented natural history**: The disease's progression must be sufficiently understood from historical data to provide a meaningful comparison
4. **Confirmed target engagement**: Developers must demonstrate, through biopsy, biomarker, or preclinical testing, that the therapy successfully modifies its target
5. **Consistent clinical improvement**: The patient must show meaningful improvement that cannot be explained by spontaneous regression or placebo effect

Marketing approval — as distinct from individual compassionate use — requires that a manufacturer demonstrate success with "several consecutive patients with different bespoke therapies." After approval, companies must collect real-world efficacy and safety data as a post-marketing commitment [1][4].

Critically, the pathway is intentionally narrow. It excludes multifactorial disorders, common diseases with complex molecular drivers, adult cancers with heterogeneous mutations, and conditions with existing effective treatments [3].

## What Comes Next

The CHOP-Penn team is not stopping at KJ. Dr. Ahrens-Nicklas and Dr. Musunuru plan to submit an Investigational New Drug application for a urea cycle disorder platform in 2026 and launch a Phase I/II umbrella clinical trial treating five additional patients with editable variants across seven UCD genes: CPS1, OTC, ASS1, ASA/ASL, ARG1, NAGS, and HHH [5][6].

They are also developing gene editing platforms for phenylketonuria, another rare metabolic disorder [5].

Beyond CHOP, the broader ecosystem is mobilizing. ARPA-H, the federal advanced health research agency, launched the THRIVE and GIVE programs to support precision genetic medicine development. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative has established a Center for Pediatric CRISPR Cures with an initial goal of treating eight patients [5].

The FDA has indicated it will issue joint CBER-CDER guidance to formalize the pathway, though no timeline has been committed [4].

## What We Don't Know

- **Long-term safety**: CRISPR base editing is a young technology. Off-target edits, immune reactions, developmental effects, and late-onset complications are theoretical risks that cannot be assessed in the timeframe since KJ's treatment. The PMP mandates long-term monitoring through registries and real-world evidence, but the data simply does not exist yet [3].
- **How many "consecutive patients" are enough**: The pathway requires success with "several" patients before marketing approval, but the FDA has not defined a specific number. This ambiguity could become contentious as manufacturers push for the lowest viable threshold.
- **Cost and access**: KJ's treatment required "a herculean six-month effort, involving dozens of scientists across North America and untold dollars from government and industry," according to STAT News [7]. Whether personalized gene editing can ever be economically viable at scale — or whether it will remain available only to patients fortunate enough to be near elite research hospitals — is an open question.
- **Scope creep**: Makary and Prasad themselves acknowledged the pathway "could also extend to common conditions with numerous causative mutations" and potentially "apply beyond cell and gene therapy to other drug classes over time" [4]. Whether this expansion would maintain the rigor of the original framework is uncertain.

## Analysis

The Plausible Mechanism Pathway represents one of the most significant shifts in FDA regulatory philosophy in decades. It acknowledges a fundamental asymmetry: for a child dying of a disease that affects one in a million people, requiring a randomized controlled trial is not a higher standard of evidence — it is no evidence at all, because the trial can never be conducted.

The five requirements are carefully designed to substitute mechanistic certainty for statistical power. If a therapy targets a known genetic cause, demonstrates target engagement in preclinical models, and produces clinical improvement in a patient with a well-documented disease course, the totality of evidence can be compelling even with N=1.

But the concerns raised by bioethicists are not trivial. Holly Fernandez Lynch and others have warned that the pathway, in the wrong hands, could erode evidentiary standards across the pharmaceutical industry [7]. If a plausible mechanism is sufficient for ultra-rare diseases, the argument will inevitably be made that it should be sufficient for slightly less rare diseases, and then for niche subtypes of common diseases, and so on. The history of FDA accelerated approval — where provisional approvals based on surrogate endpoints sometimes took years to confirm with real outcomes data — offers a cautionary precedent.

The economic question is equally significant. The pharmaceutical industry has historically underfunded rare disease research precisely because the addressable market is too small to justify development costs. The PMP could change that calculus by dramatically reducing the regulatory burden — but only if manufacturing costs fall. A therapy that takes six months and dozens of scientists to produce for a single patient is a scientific triumph; it is not a scalable treatment. The umbrella trial model that the CHOP-Penn team is pioneering — using a common gene editing platform across multiple mutations in related diseases — may be the key to reducing per-patient costs.

What makes the PMP extraordinary is not just what it permits, but what it signals. The FDA, under Makary and Prasad, is staking a position that the regulatory system should adapt to the science, not the other way around. For the estimated 7,000 rare diseases — 95% of which have no approved treatment — that signal matters enormously. For the children born with conditions so rare they don't even have a name, the Plausible Mechanism Pathway is not a lowering of standards. It is the creation of a standard where none existed before.
