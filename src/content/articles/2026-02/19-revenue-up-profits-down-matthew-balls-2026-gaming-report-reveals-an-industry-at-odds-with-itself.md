## Overview

The global video game industry posted record revenues in 2025, yet an annual industry report from media analyst Matthew Ball argues that the headline number obscures a more complicated picture: margins have collapsed to below 2019 levels, private investment has cratered, and Chinese publishers are quietly capturing an outsized share of the industry's growth. Ball's [State of Video Gaming in 2026](https://www.pocketgamer.biz/matthew-balls-state-of-video-gaming-in-2026-china-is-eating-the-video-games-industry/) — an annual benchmark for the sector — puts the industry at an inflection point where operational discipline and geographic strategy matter far more than raw spending growth.

## The $195.6 Billion Paradox

Global games content sales reached **$195.6 billion in 2025**, a 5.3% year-over-year increase and an all-time high, according to [Wccftech's coverage](https://wccftech.com/global-video-game-content-sales-grew-to-195-6b-in-2025-while-private-funding-took-a-massive-dip/) of Ball's data. Console software alone hit $41.6 billion — also a record — while PC gaming extended a multi-year streak, now up 30% from its 2020 baseline without suffering the post-pandemic correction that hobbled other segments.

But as [Wccftech reports](https://wccftech.com/global-video-game-content-sales-grew-to-195-6b-in-2025-while-private-funding-took-a-massive-dip/), actual game transactions declined nearly 11%, a signal that revenue growth is being driven almost entirely by monetization of existing players rather than expansion of the player base. Platform subscription services — PlayStation Plus, Xbox Game Pass, Nintendo Switch Online — now account for the majority of console spending. Ball's data shows that U.S. player participation rates remain 2.5 to 4 percentage points below pre-pandemic levels. In short, the industry is extracting more money from a slightly smaller pool of engaged players.

Operating margins fell below 2019 levels despite the revenue surge, as [Pocket Gamer notes](https://www.pocketgamer.biz/matthew-balls-state-of-video-gaming-in-2026-china-is-eating-the-video-games-industry/), with development spending exceeding $40 billion annually for the second consecutive year. Excluding China and platform holders with captive distribution, operating profits industrywide sit below 2019 totals even as consumer spending has grown substantially in that span.

## China Is Eating the Industry

The most pointed finding in Ball's report concerns China. As summarized by [Pocket Gamer](https://www.pocketgamer.biz/matthew-balls-state-of-video-gaming-in-2026-china-is-eating-the-video-games-industry/), Ball states directly: "China is eating the video gaming industry." Chinese publishers now represent **20% of global player spending** and account for **38% of all industry growth**. Their share of overseas revenue has climbed from 11% to 14% over six years, and they have captured roughly half of all global spending growth since 2019.

The dynamic is structurally asymmetric. According to [Pocket Gamer](https://www.pocketgamer.biz/matthew-balls-state-of-video-gaming-in-2026-china-is-eating-the-video-games-industry/), Chinese players direct **84% of their spending to domestic titles** — meaning that Western publishers competing for Chinese consumers face a heavily home-field-advantaged market, while Chinese publishers expanding globally face more open competition. Ball's data points to a conclusion that studios seeking international competitiveness can no longer treat the Chinese market as optional.

The strategic implications are significant. Chinese publishers have demonstrated proficiency in mobile live service games, free-to-play monetization, and genre iteration — the exact categories where spending growth is most durable. Western studios, by contrast, have concentrated investment in high-cost single-player and premium console titles that carry elevated development risk and narrowing margins.

## The Funding Drought

Private investment in games companies fell **55% year-over-year** in 2025, according to [Wccftech's coverage](https://wccftech.com/global-video-game-content-sales-grew-to-195-6b-in-2025-while-private-funding-took-a-massive-dip/) of Ball's data. [Pocket Gamer reports](https://www.pocketgamer.biz/matthew-balls-state-of-video-gaming-in-2026-china-is-eating-the-video-games-industry/) that the final quarter of 2025 saw pre-seed investment fall below $100 million — far removed from the Q1 2022 peak of over $400 million when investors poured capital into gaming expecting pandemic-era engagement to persist.

For smaller and mid-tier studios, the funding contraction is forcing structural changes: outsourcing internal development, reducing headcounts, and in some cases abandoning projects mid-production. The layoff figure for 2025 — approximately 9,200 jobs — is lower than the 15,650 lost in 2024, a 40% improvement noted by [Pocket Gamer](https://www.pocketgamer.biz/matthew-balls-state-of-video-gaming-in-2026-china-is-eating-the-video-games-industry/). But that improvement comes partly because the studios that were going to restructure have already done so, and partly because the studios most dependent on venture capital have already closed or consolidated.

The funding drought will likely accelerate consolidation toward a smaller number of well-capitalized publishers and platform holders — companies that can absorb multi-year development cycles and market their titles at scale.

## Winners: Nintendo and Roblox

Against this backdrop, two entities have performed markedly well: Nintendo and Roblox.

The Nintendo Switch 2 has become the fastest-selling console in Nintendo's history. As [Game Developer reports](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-nintendo-switch-2-has-topped-17-million-sales-worldwide), the console reached 17.37 million units worldwide by December 31, 2025 — roughly seven months after its June 2025 launch. According to Circana U.S. data reported by [NotebookCheck](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Strong-December-Switch-2-sales-keep-console-on-record-pace-topping-PS4-s-1st-7-months-by-35.1210156.0.html), the Switch 2 outpaced PlayStation 4's first seven months of sales by 35% and is running roughly twice the original Switch's pace over the same period. [Variety notes](https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-sales-17-million-1236650699/) that the console is on track to reach 19 million units by March 2026. Mario Kart World, which launched alongside the hardware, has already sold more than 14 million copies.

Roblox, meanwhile, reached **47.3 million concurrent users** in August 2025, according to [Wccftech](https://wccftech.com/global-video-game-content-sales-grew-to-195-6b-in-2025-while-private-funding-took-a-massive-dip/). Ball characterizes Roblox as a platform that is "stealing share and growing its own garden" — a user-generated content ecosystem that operates by different rules than traditional publishers and has expanded its player base while much of the industry has contracted.

Both cases share a common thread: captive ecosystems. Nintendo benefits from exclusive software and tightly controlled hardware margins. Roblox benefits from a creator economy that lowers its content acquisition cost. Ball's data suggests that publishers lacking similar structural advantages are at a persistent disadvantage.

## The Attention Problem

Beyond the competitive pressures within gaming, Ball identifies a structural threat: social media is winning the attention war. According to [Pocket Gamer's coverage](https://www.pocketgamer.biz/matthew-balls-state-of-video-gaming-in-2026-china-is-eating-the-video-games-industry/) of the report, the "Mature Market 8" — the US, Japan, South Korea, UK, Germany, France, Canada, and Italy — are losing ground in this competition, with surveys in several of those countries showing that the share of people who describe themselves as regular gamers is now below pre-pandemic levels. Ball frames the challenge as gaming competing not against other games or traditional entertainment, but against algorithmically curated social platforms that are engineered to capture precisely the same discretionary time that gaming has historically occupied.

This framing explains the flat mobile spending figures despite a rising smartphone user base, and the stagnant U.S. participation rates despite record content availability. More games are being made, more platforms are available, and prices are higher — but the total number of people regularly engaging with games has not expanded.

## What Comes Next

Ball's 2026 report is less a celebration of the industry's record revenue than a warning about the sustainability of how that revenue is being generated. The industry has expanded its dollar take by raising prices, shifting to subscriptions, and deepening monetization of existing players — but it has not expanded its audience, has not improved its margins, and has not retained investment confidence.

The studios and publishers most likely to navigate the next phase successfully are those that can combine platform control, favorable geography, cost discipline, and a credible answer to the attention competition — a set of advantages that favors scale and ecosystem ownership over creative output alone. For everyone else, the record numbers at the top of the report may be the most misleading part of the story.
