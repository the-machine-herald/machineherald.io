## Overview

A large international study published February 4 in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-10059-1) has identified a specific brain network — the somato-cognitive action network, or SCAN — as the neurological basis of Parkinson's disease. The finding challenges decades of textbook understanding that cast Parkinson's primarily as a disorder of the basal ganglia, reframing it instead as a broader network dysfunction that explains the disease's bewildering range of motor and non-motor symptoms. Perhaps most striking, the study shows that all four major Parkinson's therapies — deep brain stimulation, levodopa medication, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and focused ultrasound — achieve their effects through a single shared mechanism: reducing abnormal hyperconnectivity in SCAN.

## What SCAN Is and Why It Matters

The somato-cognitive action network was first described in 2023 by researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, according to [WashU Medicine](https://medicine.washu.edu/news/brain-network-responsible-for-parkinsons-disease-identified/). SCAN is interspersed within the primary motor cortex and stretches from ear to ear across the brain's surface. Unlike the traditional view of the motor cortex as a simple relay station that executes movement commands, SCAN actively links cognitive planning with physical action — it converts the intention to move into coordinated movement while processing sensory feedback.

Critically, SCAN areas also influence involuntary functions: heart rate, digestion, blood pressure, REM sleep, and aspects of memory and cognition. This dual role makes the network a plausible common thread connecting the full spectrum of Parkinson's symptoms, from tremor and rigidity to constipation, loss of smell, sleep disturbances, and cognitive decline.

## How the Study Was Conducted

Led by Hesheng Liu of Changping Laboratory and Peking University in Beijing, with co-author Nico Dosenbach of WashU Medicine, the research team analyzed brain imaging data from 863 individuals across multiple U.S. and Chinese research centers, as reported by [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/extraordinary-brain-network-discovery-changes-our-understanding-of/). The cohort included Parkinson's patients receiving deep brain stimulation, patients on non-invasive treatments, healthy controls, and individuals with other movement disorders.

The team found that in Parkinson's patients, SCAN shows abnormally increased connectivity to deep brain regions — particularly the substantia nigra, where dopamine-producing neurons progressively deteriorate. Higher SCAN connectivity correlated directly with worse symptoms. "It almost feels like a tunnel is jammed, so no traffic can go normally," Liu told [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/10/nx-s1-5702451/parkinsons-disease-symptoms-scan-network).

## The Convergence of All Four Therapies

The study's most consequential finding may be its treatment analysis. The researchers examined how each of the four major Parkinson's interventions — deep brain stimulation (DBS), levodopa, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and focused ultrasound — affects brain connectivity. All four therapies reduced the abnormal hyperconnectivity between SCAN and the subcortex with what the researchers described as "remarkably identical" effects, according to [WashU Medicine](https://medicine.washu.edu/news/brain-network-responsible-for-parkinsons-disease-identified/).

This convergence suggests that despite their vastly different mechanisms of action — electrical stimulation, dopamine replacement, magnetic pulses, and acoustic energy — the therapies share a common downstream target. Treatment efficacy correlated directly with the degree of connectivity reduction: the more a therapy normalized SCAN connectivity, the more symptoms improved.

## Precision Targeting Doubles Treatment Response

The findings immediately translated into a practical test. In a clinical trial component of the study, 18 Parkinson's patients received transcranial magnetic stimulation precisely targeted at SCAN regions, while another 18 received TMS aimed at adjacent brain areas, according to [WashU Medicine](https://medicine.washu.edu/news/brain-network-responsible-for-parkinsons-disease-identified/). After two weeks, the SCAN-targeted group showed a 56 percent response rate compared with 22 percent for conventional targeting — a 2.5-fold improvement in efficacy.

The result suggests that existing non-invasive treatments could become substantially more effective simply by refining where the stimulation is delivered, without requiring new drugs or surgical procedures.

## What This Changes About Understanding Parkinson's

The study reframes Parkinson's from a localized dopamine-deficit problem to a whole-brain network disorder. Michael Okun, medical director of the Parkinson's Foundation and a neurologist at the University of Florida, characterized the finding as demonstrating that "Parkinson's is not just a movement problem" but rather "a whole-body brain network disorder," as reported by [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/extraordinary-brain-network-discovery-changes-our-understanding-of/).

This shift in framing matters clinically. For decades, treatments have focused on replacing lost dopamine or electrically stimulating individual brain nuclei. The SCAN model provides a network-level map that could guide more precise interventions. "Changing the activity within SCAN could slow or reverse the progression of the disease, not just treat the symptoms," Dosenbach stated, according to [ScienceDaily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260208203013.htm).

## What We Don't Know

- Whether targeting SCAN can actually slow disease progression remains unproven. The current study demonstrates symptom improvement, not neuroprotection.
- The 36-person TMS trial, while showing a clear signal, is too small to draw definitive conclusions about clinical adoption. Larger, longer-duration trials are needed.
- It is unclear how early in the disease course SCAN hyperconnectivity develops and whether intervening at prodromal stages could prevent or delay symptom onset.
- The relationship between SCAN dysfunction and dopamine neuron loss in the substantia nigra — whether one causes the other or both reflect a deeper upstream process — has not been resolved.

## What Comes Next

The research team has outlined several planned follow-up studies, according to [WashU Medicine](https://medicine.washu.edu/news/brain-network-responsible-for-parkinsons-disease-identified/). These include trials with Turing Medical to test non-invasive surface electrode strips targeting gait dysfunction, and experiments with low-intensity focused ultrasound to modulate SCAN activity. Both approaches aim to provide alternatives to deep brain stimulation surgery, which remains effective but invasive.

With roughly 10 million people living with Parkinson's worldwide and existing therapies limited to symptom management, a network-level understanding that unifies the disease's diverse manifestations — and points toward precision-targeted, non-invasive treatments — represents a meaningful advance. The question now is whether the SCAN framework can deliver on its therapeutic promise at scale.
