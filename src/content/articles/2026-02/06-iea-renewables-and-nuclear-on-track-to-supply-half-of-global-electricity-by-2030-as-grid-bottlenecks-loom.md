## Overview

The International Energy Agency's annual **Electricity 2026** report, published on February 6, projects that renewables and nuclear power together will generate roughly **50 percent of global electricity by 2030** — up from 42 percent today. The milestone signals an acceleration in the energy transition, but the report couples the optimism with a stark warning: over **2,500 gigawatts** of clean-energy projects are stalled in grid connection queues worldwide, threatening to slow the very progress the numbers celebrate.

## What We Know

### Demand Is Surging

Global power demand is set to grow by more than **3.5 percent per year** on average through the end of the decade, according to the IEA [1]. That rate is roughly 2.5 times faster than the growth of total energy demand — a dynamic the agency characterizes as the dawn of an "Age of Electricity." The increase through 2030 would be equivalent to adding more than two European Unions' worth of electricity consumption.

The surge is being driven by four converging forces: rising industrial electrification, accelerating electric-vehicle adoption, growing air-conditioning demand in warming economies, and the rapid expansion of data centers fueled by artificial intelligence workloads. The IEA has separately estimated that data-center electricity consumption could double to roughly 945 terawatt-hours by 2030 [3].

### Clean Energy Is Catching Up

Renewable electricity generation essentially matched coal-fired output in 2025 and is now pulling ahead, according to the report [1]. Solar photovoltaic alone is expected to contribute more than 600 terawatt-hours of new output annually, with total renewable generation expanding at approximately 8 percent per year through the end of the decade.

Nuclear power reached record output levels in 2025, bolstered by reactor restarts in Japan, robust production in France and the United States, and new capacity additions in China and India [1]. Combined, renewables and nuclear are on pace to supply half of the world's electricity within four years.

Natural gas-fired generation is also expanding — particularly in the United States and the Middle East — while coal generation is projected to recede to 2021 levels by 2030.

### The Grid Is the Bottleneck

The report's most pointed finding concerns electricity grids. More than **2,500 gigawatts** of generation projects — overwhelmingly renewables — are stuck in connection queues around the world, waiting years for grid approvals [2]. The IEA estimates that up to **1,600 GW** of those queued projects could be connected using existing grid-enhancing technologies without requiring entirely new transmission infrastructure.

IEA Executive Director **Fatih Birol** emphasized that a "rapid expansion of grids and flexibility" will be essential to keep pace with demand, stating that annual grid investment must rise by approximately **50 percent by 2030** [1].

### Emissions and Affordability

Global CO2 emissions from electricity generation are expected to remain roughly flat through 2030 — a sign that clean-energy growth is offsetting the demand surge, but not yet bending the curve downward. At the same time, household electricity prices in many countries have risen faster than incomes since 2019, raising affordability concerns that the IEA flags as a growing policy challenge [2].

## What We Don't Know

The report does not specify how quickly governments will act to clear grid connection backlogs, which vary widely by country and regulatory environment. It remains uncertain whether the 50-percent target will hold if grid constraints delay major solar and wind deployments.

The trajectory for data-center electricity demand is also highly sensitive to assumptions about AI adoption rates and efficiency gains. While the IEA's base-case projection points to a doubling of data-center consumption, faster-than-expected AI scaling could push demand higher, adding further pressure on grids already struggling to keep pace.

Finally, the flat emissions outlook assumes clean-energy connections proceed on schedule — a condition the report itself calls into question given the scale of the grid bottleneck.

## Analysis

The Electricity 2026 report marks a notable shift in framing: the IEA's central concern is no longer whether the world can build enough clean generation, but whether the wires exist to deliver it. Renewable costs have fallen to the point where deployment economics are favorable nearly everywhere; the constraint has migrated from generation to transmission.

The 2,500-GW queue figure is particularly striking. For context, total global installed power capacity is roughly 9,000 GW — meaning projects equal to more than a quarter of existing capacity are waiting for permission to connect. If the IEA's estimate that 1,600 GW could be unlocked with grid-enhancing technologies is accurate, the gap between ambition and delivery is primarily institutional and regulatory, not technological.

The convergence of the AI-driven data-center boom with the electrification of transport and industry creates a compounding demand challenge that earlier transition models did not fully anticipate. The IEA's insistence on a 50-percent increase in grid investment by 2030 amounts to a call for infrastructure spending at a scale and pace that few governments have yet committed to.
