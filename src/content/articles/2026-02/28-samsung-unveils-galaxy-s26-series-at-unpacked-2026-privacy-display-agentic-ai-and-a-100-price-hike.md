Samsung took the stage in San Francisco on February 25 to unveil the Galaxy S26 series at its annual Galaxy Unpacked event, presenting three new flagship phones — the Galaxy S26, S26+, and S26 Ultra — alongside the Galaxy Buds 4. The lineup doubles down on AI as its primary differentiator and introduces the mobile industry's first built-in Privacy Display on the Ultra model, though the announcement comes with a $100 price increase on the base and mid-tier models.

## Pricing and Availability

According to [Shacknews](https://www.shacknews.com/article/148021/samsung-galaxy-s26-announcement-release-date-price), the Galaxy S26 starts at $899 and the S26+ at $1,099, each $100 more than their S25 predecessors. The Galaxy S26 Ultra remains priced at $1,299 for the 256GB configuration — holding steady from last year. Pre-orders opened on February 25, with all three phones set to ship on March 11, 2026. Samsung has discontinued the 128GB storage tier across the lineup, making 256GB the new baseline.

## Galaxy S26 and S26+: Incremental but Meaningful Upgrades

As [PhoneArena reports](https://www.phonearena.com/galaxy-s26-release-date-price-features-news), the base Galaxy S26 gains a slightly larger 6.3-inch FHD+ display (up from 6.2 inches on the S25) and a meaningfully larger 4,300 mAh battery, up from 4,000 mAh. The S26+ maintains its 6.7-inch Quad HD+ display and 4,900 mAh battery. Camera hardware on both models is unchanged from the S25 — 50 MP main, 12 MP ultrawide, and 10 MP telephoto — with improvements arriving through new AI-driven software features.

In the United States, both models are powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, while European variants use Samsung's Exynos 2600 chip. All configurations include 12 GB of RAM and ship with Android 16 under Samsung's new One UI 8.5 skin.

## Galaxy S26 Ultra: Privacy Display and Camera Gains

The Galaxy S26 Ultra is the most substantially updated model in the lineup. Its headline feature — highlighted by [GSMArena](https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_s26_ultra_arrives_with_privacy_display_sd_8_elite_gen_5_for_galaxy_and_60w_charging_-news-71717.php) — is a built-in Privacy Display using Flex Magic Pixel technology, which controls how pixels disperse light at side angles. Users can toggle the feature globally or restrict it to specific applications, password fields, or notification banners, preventing shoulder surfing without requiring a privacy screen protector.

The Ultra's 6.9-inch LTPO AMOLED display offers QHD+ resolution and a 1–120 Hz adaptive refresh rate. Its 200 MP main camera now features a wider f/1.4 aperture, reportedly gathering 47 percent more light than its predecessor, while the 5x telephoto lens receives a brighter f/2.9 aperture said to be 37 percent more efficient in low-light conditions. The device is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 for Galaxy globally — the first time Samsung has applied the same chip worldwide for the Ultra — with Samsung noting a 39 percent improvement in NPU performance over the previous generation.

Charging sees a meaningful step forward: the Ultra now supports 60W wired charging (up from 45W), reaching 75 percent battery from zero in 30 minutes. Wireless charging tops out at 25W via Qi 2.2 chargers. The device weighs 214 grams and measures 7.2 mm thick, slightly slimmer than the S25 Ultra, with an Armor Aluminum frame replacing the titanium used on last year's model.

## Galaxy AI: Agentic Features and Third-Party Integrations

According to [Engadget](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2026-the-galaxy-s26-series-ai-and-other-products-we-might-see-on-february-25-130000135.html), the S26 series ships with enhanced Galaxy AI capabilities centered on what Samsung calls agentic AI — the ability for the phone to proactively surface relevant information rather than waiting to be queried. Two new features, Now Nudge and the updated Now Brief, surface contextual suggestions based on the user's current activity, reducing the need to switch between apps. Circle to Search has been updated with multi-object recognition.

Samsung has integrated both Google Gemini and Perplexity as AI engine options within One UI 8.5, and Bixby has been revised to support natural language commands and to hand off tasks to third-party AI agents. Photo editing gains several AI-powered tools, including day-to-night scene conversion, object restoration for images with missing or obscured elements, and a multi-photo merge feature.

## Galaxy Buds 4

Alongside the phones, Samsung announced the Galaxy Buds 4, which add head gesture controls for managing calls and alarms via nod or shake motions. The earbuds include an Ultra Wideband chip enabling tracking through Google's Find Hub network, and the charging case can function as a remote camera shutter for connected Galaxy devices.

## Context

The S26 launch arrives against a backdrop of global RAM shortages that have pushed up component costs — a factor Samsung cited in explaining the $100 price increase on the base and mid-tier models. The Galaxy S26 Edge, which had been rumored as a fourth model in the lineup, was shelved ahead of the event, though Samsung has not ruled out a later release in 2026.

The full Galaxy S26 series goes on sale March 11.
