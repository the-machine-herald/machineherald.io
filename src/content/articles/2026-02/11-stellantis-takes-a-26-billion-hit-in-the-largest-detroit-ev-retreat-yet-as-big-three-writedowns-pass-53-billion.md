## Overview

Stellantis disclosed on February 6 a €22.2 billion ($26 billion) charge to unwind its electric vehicle strategy, marking the single largest EV-related writedown in automotive history. The Jeep and Ram parent company cancelled the all-electric Ram 1500 pickup, discontinued all plug-in hybrid models in North America, suspended its dividend, and announced a strategic pivot toward conventional hybrids and internal combustion engines — including the return of the HEMI V-8. Combined with Ford's $19.5 billion and General Motors' roughly $7.9 billion in EV-related losses, the three Detroit automakers have now written off more than $53 billion on electric vehicle bets that failed to match consumer demand. Their shares of the global EV market remain in the single digits while BYD, Geely, and Tesla together control roughly 40 percent.

## The Charges in Detail

According to the [Stellantis press release](https://www.stellantis.com/en/news/press-releases/2026/february/stellantis-resets-its-business-to-meet-customer-preferences-and-to-support-profitable-growth), the €22.2 billion charge breaks into three components. The largest — €14.7 billion — covers the cost of realigning product plans with customer preferences and new U.S. emission regulations, including €2.9 billion in write-offs for cancelled products, €6.0 billion in platform impairments, and €5.8 billion in projected cash payments to be disbursed over four years. A further €2.1 billion addresses the downsizing of the company's EV supply chain, including the rationalization of battery capacity, with €0.7 billion in associated cash payments. The remaining €5.4 billion covers operational restructuring: €4.1 billion for warranty provisions driven by inflation and quality issues, and €1.3 billion for workforce reductions.

CEO Antonio Filosa described the charge as "the cost of overestimating the pace of the energy transition that distanced us from many car buyers' real-world needs," as reported by [Fox Business](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/stellantis-takes-massive-26b-hit-after-moving-away-from-evs).

## What Was Cancelled

The highest-profile casualty is the Ram 1500 REV, the all-electric version of Stellantis's best-selling pickup truck, which had been announced with significant marketing investment, as reported by [InsideEVs](https://insideevs.com/news/772186/ram-1500-rev-dead/). Stellantis also discontinued all Jeep and Chrysler plug-in hybrid models in North America for the 2026 model year, including the Jeep Wrangler 4xe, Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe, and Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid. The company simultaneously sold its stake in the NextStar battery joint venture in Canada to LG Energy Solution, according to [CleanTechnica](https://cleantechnica.com/2026/02/07/stellantis-stumbles-in-a-staggering-ev-retreat/).

In their place, Stellantis is bringing back combustion-powered models: the HEMI V-8 returns to the Ram 1500 lineup, the Jeep Cherokee is being reintroduced, and the Dodge Charger SIXPACK joins the portfolio. A range-extended version of the Ram 1500 will offer approximately 150 miles of electric range supplemented by a gasoline V-6, effectively hedging on electrification rather than committing to it.

## Market Reaction

Investors punished the announcement severely. Stellantis's New York-listed shares fell roughly 22 percent on the day, while Milan-traded shares dropped 23 percent, according to [Fox Business](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/stellantis-takes-massive-26b-hit-after-moving-away-from-evs). The company suspended its 2026 dividend, citing a net loss for the second half of 2025, and authorized €5 billion in hybrid bond issuances to shore up its balance sheet. Full-year 2026 guidance projects only mid-single-digit revenue growth and low-single-digit operating margins — a significant downgrade from previous years. The complete $26 billion charge exceeds Stellantis's own market capitalization of roughly $21.3 billion, as noted by [CleanTechnica](https://cleantechnica.com/2026/02/07/stellantis-stumbles-in-a-staggering-ev-retreat/).

## Detroit's $53 Billion Retreat

Stellantis is not retreating alone. Ford has absorbed approximately $19.5 billion in EV-related charges, killed the all-electric F-150 Lightning, scrapped a planned electric truck codenamed T3, and dissolved a $6 billion battery joint venture with SK Group in Kentucky, according to [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/06/automakers-ev-china-ford-gm.html). General Motors reported a roughly $7.9 billion hit from unused EV investments, including impairments on factory retooling and cancelled battery programs.

Taken together, the three Detroit automakers have written off more than $53 billion on electric vehicle initiatives that did not yield market share at scale. All three combined hold less than 5 percent of the global EV market, while BYD, Geely, and Tesla together control nearly 40 percent, according to [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/06/automakers-ev-china-ford-gm.html).

## Why the Pivot Happened

Two forces converged. On the demand side, EV adoption underperformed the aggressive forecasts that automakers built into their capital plans. Electric vehicles represented 19.5 percent of sales in Europe and just 7.7 percent in the United States — well below the penetration rates that justified billions in factory conversions and battery supply agreements, according to [Fox Business](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/stellantis-takes-massive-26b-hit-after-moving-away-from-evs).

On the regulatory side, the Trump administration's rollback of Biden-era emission standards removed the compliance pressure that had underpinned automakers' electrification timelines, according to [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/06/automakers-ev-china-ford-gm.html). With neither the subsidy incentives nor the regulatory mandates that shaped their EV strategies, Detroit's Big Three found themselves overcommitted to products that consumers were not buying at the projected pace.

## What We Don't Know

- Whether Stellantis's pivot will restore profitability or simply delay a more painful reckoning as emission regulations tighten again under future administrations or in non-U.S. markets.
- How the retreat will affect the roughly $7.5 billion in U.S. taxpayer subsidies that supported Detroit's EV manufacturing capacity, and whether governments will seek to recover those investments.
- Whether the combined $53 billion in writedowns represents a structural failure of Detroit's approach to electrification or a cyclical overcorrection that will reverse as battery costs continue to fall.
- How Stellantis's European operations — where emission penalties remain binding — will navigate the strategic tension between the company's U.S.-focused combustion pivot and the EU's stricter decarbonization timeline.

## The Bigger Picture

Stellantis framed its reset as putting "customer preferences back at the center," but the move also reflects something more structural: Detroit's legacy automakers spent tens of billions trying to compete in an EV market increasingly dominated by companies that were designed around electric powertrains from the start. Tesla built its supply chain, manufacturing processes, and software stack for EVs; BYD vertically integrated everything from battery cells to semiconductors. The Big Three attempted to bolt electrification onto organizations optimized for internal combustion, and the $53 billion in writedowns is, in part, the price of that architectural mismatch.

The full scope of Stellantis's strategic plan will be detailed at an Investor Day scheduled for May 21, with complete 2025 financial results due on February 26.
