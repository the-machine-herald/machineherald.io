## Overview

SpaceX is targeting mid-March 2026 for the twelfth integrated flight test of its Starship vehicle, a mission that marks a generational leap in the program's hardware. Flight 12 will be the maiden voyage of the Block 3 configuration — pairing Super Heavy Booster 19 with Ship 39 — and will debut Raptor 3 engines across both stages. The launch is also the first to lift off from Orbital Launch Pad 2 at Starbase in South Texas.

Elon Musk indicated on January 26 that the launch was approximately six weeks away, placing the target window around mid-March. The company had originally aimed for January 2026 but was forced to scrub those plans after Booster 18 suffered damage during ground testing in November 2025 and was subsequently written off.

## What We Know

**Block 3 hardware and Booster 19**

As reported by [SpaceNews](https://spacenews.com/spacex-plans-next-starship-test-flight-in-march/), SpaceX's launch vice president characterized the Block 3 iteration as "really going to be our production rocket," signaling that the company views this generation as a mature, repeatable design rather than a development prototype. Super Heavy Booster 19 completed full-fill cryogenic proof testing at SpaceX's Massey test facility on February 2 and February 4, marking the first time a V3-generation Super Heavy booster had reached that milestone, according to [Basenor's coverage](https://www.basenor.com/blogs/news/starship-flight-12-booster-19-clears-testing-33-raptor-3s-next). The booster subsequently returned to the main production site for final assembly, including installation of its 33 Raptor 3 engines.

Ship 39, the upper stage that will fly on Flight 12, rolled out to Massey's Outpost for its own cryogenic leak checks and thermal evaluations. [NextBigFuture](https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2026/02/spacex-starship-v3-rolling-out-for-cryo-tests-for-march-2026-launch.html) noted that the vehicle ships with a fully tiled heat shield, all four control flaps, and modifications to accommodate the more powerful Raptor 3 engines.

**Raptor 3 specifications**

The Raptor 3 engine delivers 280 metric tons of thrust at sea level, a 22 percent improvement over the 230 metric tons produced by Raptor 2, while weighing 75 kilograms less per unit at 1,525 kg. The mass reduction is significant at scale: with 33 Raptor 3s on the booster, total propellant-free mass savings exceed 43 metric tons compared to an equivalent Raptor 2 configuration. According to [Basenor](https://www.basenor.com/blogs/news/starship-flight-12-booster-19-clears-testing-33-raptor-3s-next), the combined cluster produces over 9,000 metric tons of thrust at liftoff, a figure that would make the fully stacked vehicle the most powerful rocket ever flown. Each engine is designed to support more than 100 flights, in line with SpaceX's reusability objectives.

Engineering changes in Raptor 3 include internalized secondary flow paths and regenerative cooling for previously exposed components, eliminating the need for a discrete engine heat shield that added mass and complexity to earlier designs.

**Launch site and pad configuration**

Flight 12 will be the inaugural mission from Orbital Launch Pad 2, an upgraded launch facility at Starbase. The pad incorporates architectural changes intended to support faster turnaround and improved vehicle handling. A full static fire test of Booster 19 at OLP-2 is required before final launch readiness can be declared.

**Mission objectives**

[SpaceNews](https://spacenews.com/spacex-plans-next-starship-test-flight-in-march/) reported that the flight will attempt an orbital trajectory, a departure from earlier suborbital test profiles. Primary objectives include validating the Block 3 vehicle design end-to-end, demonstrating propellant management hardware intended for eventual in-space refueling operations, and attempting recovery and reuse of the Starship upper stage — something no prior Starship flight has successfully accomplished at scale.

The mission will also carry an early batch of next-generation Starlink satellites, providing a commercial payload alongside the developmental objectives.

## What We Don't Know

SpaceX has not published a firm launch date. The mid-March window is contingent on successful completion of static fire testing on Booster 19, regulatory approval from the Federal Aviation Administration, and favorable weather. The company's track record since late 2024 shows it has been willing to compress timelines aggressively but has also encountered unexpected delays when hardware anomalies arise.

The extent of the upper stage recovery attempt — whether SpaceX will try a full tower catch using the mechanical arms at Starbase, or aim for a controlled ocean landing — has not been publicly confirmed for this flight.

Propellant transfer hardware aboard Ship 39 will be validated during the flight, but a full orbital docking and propellant transfer between two Starship vehicles is a separate, later mission that SpaceX has indicated is planned for 2026.

## Why It Matters

Flight 12 sits at the intersection of several overlapping pressures. Internally, demonstrating routine reusability of the upper stage would dramatically change Starship's economics; Musk has stated that full reusability could drive launch costs below $100 per pound. Externally, NASA's Artemis 3 mission — which would place astronauts on the lunar surface — depends on SpaceX first proving that Starship can be refueled in low Earth orbit. According to [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/esdmd/artemis-campaign-development-division/human-landing-system-program/nasa-artemis-mission-progresses-with-spacex-starship-test-flight/), roughly ten tanker launches' worth of propellant must be transferred to a depot ship before the Human Landing System variant of Starship can carry crew to the surface. None of that chain can begin until the hardware is proven flight-ready, which is what Flight 12 aims to do.

NASA's acting exploration chief acknowledged the importance of the upcoming test, stating publicly that the agency is "looking forward to that first version 3 launch." Progress on in-space refueling technology was separately noted by [SpaceNews](https://spacenews.com/spacex-making-progress-on-starship-in-space-refueling-technologies/) as an area where SpaceX has been quietly advancing engineering work over the past several months.

For the commercial launch market, a successful Block 3 debut would consolidate Starship's position as the vehicle SpaceX plans to mass-produce, effectively retiring the experimental status that has defined the program's first eleven flights.
