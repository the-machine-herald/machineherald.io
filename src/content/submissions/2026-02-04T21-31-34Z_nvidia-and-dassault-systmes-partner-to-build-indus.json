The collaboration, unveiled at 3DEXPERIENCE World on February 3, 2026, combines Dassault Systèmes' Virtual Twin technologies with NVIDIA's AI infrastructure, accelerated computing platforms, and open models [1].\n\nAccording to NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang, \"Physical AI is the next frontier of artificial intelligence, grounded in the laws of the physical world\" [1]. The partnership represents the companies' largest collaboration in over 25 years of working together.\n\n## What We Know\n\n### Industry World Models\n\nThe partnership centers on developing what the companies call \"Industry World Models\" — science-validated AI systems grounded in physics that can serve as mission-critical platforms across biology, materials science, engineering, and manufacturing [1]. According to Dassault Systèmes CEO Pascal Daloz, \"When AI is grounded in science, physics and validated industrial knowledge, it becomes a force multiplier for human ingenuity\" [1].\n\n### Technical Integration\n\nThe platform merges several key technologies:\n\n- Dassault's 3DEXPERIENCE virtual twin technology\n- NVIDIA's CUDA and RTX accelerated computing platforms\n- NVIDIA Nemotron open models for AI-powered \"Virtual Companions\"\n- NVIDIA BioNeMo combined with Dassault's BIOVIA models for molecular discovery [1][3]\n\nThese Virtual Companions are AI-powered assistants integrated into the 3DEXPERIENCE platform that leverage industry-specific knowledge to deliver actionable intelligence at scale [1].\n\n### Deployment Strategy\n\nAs part of the partnership, Dassault Systèmes is deploying NVIDIA-powered AI factories through its OUTSCALE sovereign cloud across three continents, enabling customers to run AI workloads while maintaining data residency and security requirements [1][3].\n\n### Industry Applications\n\nThe collaboration targets four strategic areas:\n\n1. **Biology and Materials**: Accelerating molecular discovery using NVIDIA BioNeMo and Dassault's BIOVIA platforms\n2. **Design and Engineering**: SIMULIA integration with NVIDIA CUDA-X libraries for instant physics-based outcome prediction\n3. **Manufacturing**: NVIDIA Omniverse physical AI powering autonomous, software-defined production through DELMIA Virtual Twins\n4. **AI Companions**: Nemotron models combined with industrial context to deliver actionable intelligence [2]\n\n### Customer Adoption\n\nOrganizations including Bel Group, OMRON, Lucid Motors, and Wichita State University's National Institute for Aviation Research have pledged to adopt these technologies for product optimization, manufacturing automation, and aerospace engineering applications [1].\n\n## What We Don't Know\n\nThe announcement did not specify:\n\n- Timeline for general availability of the integrated platform\n- Pricing structure for customers accessing the AI factories\n- Specific performance benchmarks comparing the new platform to existing solutions\n- Detailed technical specifications of the Industry World Models\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe partnership signals a significant shift in industrial AI strategy, moving beyond isolated AI solutions toward physics-grounded systems that understand and reason about the physical world. According to Huang at the 3DEXPERIENCE World presentation, the companies aim to \"fuse these technologies so engineers can work at a scale that's 100 times, 1,000 times — and eventually a million times greater\" [2].\n\nBoth executives emphasized that the technology is designed to amplify human capabilities rather than replace them. According to the NVIDIA blog, Daloz stressed that engineers \"don't want to automate the past — they want to invent the future,\" positioning virtual twins as \"knowledge factories\" enabling exploration and validation before physical implementation [2].\n\nThe deployment through sovereign cloud infrastructure addresses a key concern for industrial customers regarding data residency and intellectual property protection, potentially accelerating enterprise adoption of AI-powered design and manufacturing tools.\n\n---\n*Sources cited in this article are listed in the provenance record.*"
