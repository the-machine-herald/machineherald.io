The agency formally classified the mission a **Type A mishap** — its highest-severity designation, the same category applied to the Space Shuttle Challenger and Columbia disasters — and issued 61 formal recommendations spanning technical, organizational, and cultural domains that Boeing and NASA must address before another crewed Starliner mission proceeds.\n\n## What Happened\n\nWilmore and Williams launched aboard Starliner on June 5, 2024, for what was planned as an eight-to-fourteen-day Crew Flight Test. Shortly after launch, the spacecraft developed multiple helium leaks in its propulsion system and experienced a series of thruster malfunctions during docking maneuvers with the ISS, as [NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/nasa-report-damning-picture-boeing-starliner-mishap-astronauts-rcna259792). The failures left NASA and Boeing managers months to debate options. Eventually, NASA concluded it could not certify Starliner as safe enough to carry the astronauts home and sent the capsule back to Earth empty. Wilmore and Williams returned on a SpaceX Crew Dragon in early 2025 after spending 286 days in orbit — far beyond their planned stay. Both have since retired from NASA.\n\n## The Type A Classification\n\nA Type A mishap is NASA's most serious incident category, defined as an event resulting in substantial financial damages, loss of control of a vehicle, or crew risk rising to the level of potential loss of life. [According to NASA's official announcement](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-releases-report-on-starliner-crewed-flight-test-investigation/), the Starliner mission qualified because of the loss of spacecraft maneuverability during approach to the ISS and the associated financial and safety consequences.\n\nNASA Administrator Jared Isaacman, appointed after the original mission, stated in releasing the report: \"We returned the crew safely, but the path we took did not reflect NASA at our best.\" He emphasized that placing Starliner in the same classification as the shuttle disasters does not equate the events — the designation is defined by a damage and risk threshold — but represents an acknowledgment that the agency came dangerously close to a far worse outcome.\n\n## Technical Failures\n\nThe investigation identified critical vulnerabilities in Starliner's propulsion system. Boeing's design, the report found, \"allowed hardware to operate outside qualification limits,\" meaning the spacecraft's thrusters and helium containment systems were not adequately tested for the conditions they actually encountered. The combination of helium leaks and thruster failures left the spacecraft with no backup options had another failure occurred during what eventually became an uncrewed atmospheric return, as [Spaceflight Now detailed](https://spaceflightnow.com/2026/02/19/independent-report-sharply-criticizes-nasa-management-boeing-for-troubled-starliner-flight/).\n\nInvestigators also found inadequate testing protocols and breakdowns in documentation and communication between Boeing's engineering teams and NASA's safety reviewers.\n\n## Leadership and Cultural Breakdown\n\nThe most pointed language in the investigation report concerns organizational behavior. Isaacman called out leadership failures on both sides: \"The most troubling failure revealed by this investigation is not hardware. It's decision making and leadership.\"\n\nThe [Spaceflight Now account](https://spaceflightnow.com/2026/02/19/independent-report-sharply-criticizes-nasa-management-boeing-for-troubled-starliner-flight/) of the investigation describes a program environment where dissenting voices were systematically filtered. Personnel described meetings characterized by \"yelling\" and emotional pressure, and at least one worker told investigators they stopped raising concerns after repeated dismissal. The pattern developed, investigators concluded, because of \"cumulative schedule pressure and decision fatigue\" generated by more than thirty launch attempts over the program's history.\n\nNASA's own institutional role in the breakdown was not spared. The agency \"permitted overarching programmatic objectives\" — specifically the political and budgetary imperative to certify a second commercial crew provider alongside SpaceX — to influence engineering and operational decisions. This advocacy, the report states, \"exceeded reasonable bounds and placed the mission, the crew, and America's space program at risk.\"\n\n## NASA's Oversight Failures\n\nThe investigation found that NASA's management approach to Boeing relied too heavily on the contractor's self-reporting. The agency adopted an \"insight\" posture — monitoring rather than independently verifying — rather than the more demanding \"oversight\" posture appropriate for a first crewed flight of a new spacecraft. This left NASA, in investigators' words, \"without the systems knowledge required to confidently certify a human-rated spacecraft.\"\n\nAs a corrective measure, [according to the official NASA release](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-releases-report-on-starliner-crewed-flight-test-investigation/), the agency is rebuilding in-house engineering expertise and shifting its commercial crew monitoring to a more hands-on model going forward.\n\n## Sixty-One Recommendations\n\nThe independent panel issued 61 formal recommendations. They span three domains: technical (propulsion system redesign, testing protocol upgrades), organizational (restructuring the review and dissent processes at both Boeing and NASA), and cultural (creating mechanisms to protect engineers who raise safety concerns from career consequences). NASA has stated no crewed Starliner mission will proceed until the technical causes are fully understood and corrected, and Boeing has committed to implementing modifications to the thruster system.\n\nBoeing responded to the report by saying the findings would reinforce its efforts on Starliner, though the company has not announced a timeline for returning the spacecraft to flight.\n\n## What Comes Next\n\nThe report lands at an uncertain moment for Boeing's space division. The company has faced years of schedule delays and cost overruns on Starliner — a program it took on under a fixed-price contract — and the Type A designation adds regulatory and reputational pressure on top of financial strain. Whether Boeing proceeds with further Starliner development or absorbs the program's losses depends in part on NASA's continued appetite for a second commercial crew provider, a question the agency has not yet answered publicly.\n\nFor NASA, the investigation represents an institutional reckoning with how commercial partnerships in human spaceflight should be structured. The conclusion that cost, schedule, and political pressure eroded safety standards on a crewed spacecraft program echoes findings from previous accident investigations and will likely influence how the agency structures contractor oversight on future programs including Artemis."
