According to Linus Torvalds, the kernel is now transitioning from the \"mainly preparation and infrastructure phase\" to \"actual driver and subsystems development\" for Rust code.\n\n## What We Know\n\n### Release Timeline\n\nLinux 6.19-rc4 was released on January 4, 2026, following a quiet holiday period. According to Phoronix, Torvalds has indicated the release cycle will extend to rc8 rather than the typical rc7, placing the stable release on February 8.\n\n### Rust Driver Core Changes\n\nThe driver core updates in Linux 6.19 introduce several Rust capabilities, according to Phoronix:\n\n- **I2C driver support**: Linux 6.19 now supports I2C drivers written entirely in Rust, including sample driver code and supporting infrastructure\n- **Auxiliary device driver support** improvements for better device abstraction\n- **Binary large objects (BLOBs) with DebugFS** support\n- **Enhanced device probe handling** for improved initialization\n- **I/O and PCI improvements** for hardware interactions\n\n### Nova GPU Driver Progress\n\nThe Nova driver—a Rust-based successor to Nouveau for NVIDIA GSP-based GPUs—has made notable progress in 6.19. According to Phoronix, the NVIDIA GPU System Processor (GSP) is now fully initialized and booted for Ampere GPUs.\n\nNova is designed to support all NVIDIA GPUs from the GeForce RTX 20 (Turing) series onward. The project uses a two-part architecture: Nova-Core for fundamental hardware interaction and Nova-DRM for graphics-specific interfaces. This split allows other drivers, including VFIO virtualization drivers, to build on top of Nova-Core.\n\nHowever, the driver is \"not yet ready for end-user usage,\" emphasizing this remains experimental infrastructure code.\n\n### Other Notable Features\n\nLinux 6.19 also includes:\n\n- Intel Nova Lake S audio support\n- DRM Color Pipeline API support\n- Initial Intel Xe3P support\n- hwmon support for AMD Steam Deck APU\n- 1600 Gbps link mode support in networking\n- New Terminus 10×18 bitmap console font\n\n## What We Don't Know\n\n- When Nova will be ready for end-user deployment on NVIDIA Turing and newer GPUs\n- The timeline for additional Rust drivers beyond I2C\n- Whether the extended rc8 release cycle indicates any significant issues\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe transition from infrastructure to actual driver development represents a maturation point for Rust in the Linux kernel. Following the December 2025 announcement that Rust in the kernel is no longer experimental, Linux 6.19 demonstrates concrete progress with working I2C driver support and advancing GPU driver infrastructure.\n\nThe Nova driver's progress on Ampere GPU initialization suggests that Rust-based graphics drivers could eventually provide an alternative path for NVIDIA open-source support on Linux, though substantial work remains before end users will benefit.\n\n---\n*Sources cited in this article are listed in the provenance record.*"
