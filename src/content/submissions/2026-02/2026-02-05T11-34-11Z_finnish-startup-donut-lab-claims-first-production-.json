    "body_markdown": "## Overview\n\nFinnish battery startup Donut Lab announced at CES 2026 what it claims is the world's first production-ready all-solid-state battery for electric vehicles. The company says its technology is already being manufactured at gigawatt-hour scale and will ship in Verge Motorcycles starting Q1 2026, making it the first commercial EV to use solid-state battery technology.\n\n## What We Know\n\n### Claimed Specifications\n\nAccording to Donut Lab and multiple press reports [1][2], the battery offers:\n\n- **Energy density:** 400 Wh/kg, nearly double the ~200 Wh/kg typical of current lithium-ion cells\n- **Charging time:** Full charge in as little as 5 minutes\n- **Cycle life:** Up to 100,000 cycles without significant capacity degradation\n- **Temperature performance:** Retains over 99% capacity from -30°C (-22°F) to above 100°C (212°F)\n- **Safety:** Eliminates flammable liquid electrolytes, preventing thermal runaway\n\nDonut Lab CEO Marko Lehtimäki stated: \"Our answer on solid-state batteries being ready for use in OEM production vehicles is now, today, not later\" [2].\n\nThe company claims its batteries are made from \"globally abundant materials\" without rare earth elements and cost less to manufacture than comparable lithium-ion alternatives.\n\n### First Commercial Deployment\n\nVerge Motorcycles, a Finnish electric motorcycle manufacturer, will be the first to deploy the technology. According to Interesting Engineering [2], all 2026 Verge models—including the TS Pro and TS Ultra—will feature Donut Lab batteries starting in Q1 2026.\n\nThe Verge TS Pro, previously offering 217 miles of city range with conventional batteries, will now deliver up to 370 miles (600 km) with the solid-state upgrade. Charging time is listed at under 10 minutes—deliberately extended from the battery's 5-minute capability to allow riders a brief rest [1].\n\n### Other Partnerships\n\nBeyond motorcycles, Donut Lab has announced collaborations with WATTEV for modular electric skateboards, Cova Power for smart trailers, and ESOX Group for defense applications [2].\n\n## What We Don't Know\n\n### Industry Skepticism\n\nSolid-state batteries have been \"hovering just beyond the horizon\" for years, with numerous corporations and startups failing to solve manufacturing challenges at scale [3]. The industry has seen similar claims before that did not materialize into commercial products.\n\nRed Shark News notes that real-world specifications for the Verge motorcycles are more conservative than Donut Lab's headline claims—10-minute charging and 10,000-cycle performance rather than 5 minutes and 100,000 cycles [3]. While still impressive, this gap between laboratory specs and production reality warrants attention.\n\n### Unanswered Questions\n\n- What specific materials compose the battery's solid electrolyte?\n- What is the actual cost per kWh compared to lithium-ion?\n- Can the technology scale to automotive applications requiring much larger battery packs?\n- How does performance degrade over time in real-world conditions?\n\n## Industry Context\n\nDonut Lab's announcement comes as major automakers accelerate their own solid-state efforts. Toyota's partner Idemitsu Kosan broke ground on a large-scale solid electrolyte pilot plant in Japan, with completion expected by end of 2027 [4]. Toyota plans to launch EVs with solid-state batteries in 2027 or 2028, claiming prototypes with 1,200 km range and sub-10-minute charging.\n\nIf Donut Lab's claims hold up under real-world scrutiny, it would represent a significant milestone. Deliveries of Verge motorcycles in Q1 2026 will provide the first independent verification of whether solid-state battery technology has finally crossed from laboratory promise to production reality.\n\n---\n*Sources cited in this article are listed in the provenance record.*"
