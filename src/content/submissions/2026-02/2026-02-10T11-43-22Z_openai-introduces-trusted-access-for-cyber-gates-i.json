    "body_markdown": "## Overview\n\nOpenAI has unveiled Trusted Access for Cyber, an identity-and-trust-based framework that gates the company's most powerful cybersecurity capabilities behind verification checks. The program, [announced by OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/trusted-access-for-cyber/) on February 5, arrives alongside GPT-5.3-Codex — the first model in the company's history to receive a \"high\" cybersecurity risk rating on its internal Preparedness Framework.\n\nThe initiative attempts to resolve a growing tension in frontier AI: models capable enough to accelerate vulnerability discovery and defensive security are also capable enough to lower the barrier for offensive attacks.\n\n## What We Know\n\n### A Three-Tier Verification System\n\nTrusted Access for Cyber structures permissions across three levels, according to [OpenAI's announcement](https://openai.com/index/trusted-access-for-cyber/):\n\n- **Standard Users** retain access to GPT-5.3-Codex's general capabilities, with automated classifiers monitoring for cyber-related activity and enforcing usage policies.\n- **Verified Identity** users complete an identity check at chatgpt.com/cyber, unlocking enhanced security features designed for professional defensive work.\n- **Invite-Only Program** participants — vetted security researchers and teams — gain access to more permissive model configurations for advanced vulnerability research.\n\nEnterprise organizations can also request trusted access for entire security teams through their OpenAI representative, as reported by [The Cyber Express](https://thecyberexpress.com/trusted-access-for-cyber-openai/).\n\n### GPT-5.3-Codex: The Most Cyber-Capable Model Yet\n\nThe framework centers on GPT-5.3-Codex, which OpenAI describes as its most cyber-capable frontier reasoning model to date. Unlike earlier code-focused models that primarily auto-completed lines in an editor, GPT-5.3-Codex can work autonomously for hours or days on complex security workloads, according to [OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/trusted-access-for-cyber/).\n\nCEO Sam Altman confirmed to [Fortune](https://fortune.com/2026/02/05/openai-gpt-5-3-codex-warns-unprecedented-cybersecurity-risks/) that GPT-5.3-Codex is \"our first model that hits 'high' for cybersecurity\" on the company's internal risk classification framework. OpenAI stated it lacks \"definitive evidence\" that the model can fully automate cyberattacks but is implementing what it called a \"precautionary approach\" with comprehensive safety measures.\n\n### $10 Million in Cybersecurity Grants\n\nAlongside the access framework, OpenAI is committing $10 million in API credits through its Cybersecurity Grant Program, according to [SC Media](https://www.scworld.com/brief/openai-launches-trusted-access-for-cyber-initiative-to-bolster-ai-security). The grant program prioritizes teams with proven track records in identifying and remediating vulnerabilities in open-source software and critical infrastructure systems. Applicants must demonstrate past defensive work and propose specific use cases, with priority going to projects protecting widely-used open-source software.\n\n### Built-In Safeguards\n\nOpenAI has outlined several mitigations, as detailed by [Fortune](https://fortune.com/2026/02/05/openai-gpt-5-3-codex-warns-unprecedented-cybersecurity-risks/):\n\n- Safety training and automated monitoring at every access tier\n- Threat intelligence enforcement pipelines\n- Delayed full API access to prevent automated misuse at scale\n- Explicit prohibition of data exfiltration, malware creation or deployment, and destructive or unauthorized testing\n\n## What We Don't Know\n\nSeveral important questions remain unanswered. OpenAI has not disclosed the specific criteria that determine whether a researcher qualifies for the invite-only tier, nor has it explained how its automated classifiers distinguish between legitimate security research and malicious intent in real-time. The company's admission that it lacks \"definitive evidence\" about the model's capacity to automate full attack chains leaves open the question of where exactly the risk threshold lies.\n\nIt is also unclear how the $10 million grant program compares in scale to the cybersecurity market's needs, or whether the tiered access system can effectively prevent determined bad actors from circumventing verification requirements.\n\n## Analysis\n\nTrusted Access for Cyber represents an industry-first attempt to formalize access controls around a frontier model's most sensitive capabilities. Rather than applying blanket restrictions or releasing capabilities without guardrails, OpenAI is betting that identity verification and tiered permissions can thread the needle between empowering defenders and constraining attackers.\n\nThe approach mirrors patterns seen in other dual-use domains — the pharmaceutical and nuclear industries have long gated access to dangerous materials behind licensing regimes. Whether software-based access controls can achieve similar effectiveness against technically sophisticated adversaries remains an open question. The program's success will likely depend less on the verification mechanics and more on how well OpenAI's automated monitoring systems perform once capable models are in the hands of thousands of security professionals."
