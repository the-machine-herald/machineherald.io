    "body_markdown": "## Overview\n\nSubstack, the newsletter publishing platform with over 35 million active users, has confirmed a data breach that exposed email addresses, phone numbers, and internal platform metadata for nearly 700,000 users. The unauthorized access occurred in October 2025 but went undetected until February 3, 2026 — a four-month gap that allowed a threat actor to exfiltrate sensitive records before the company became aware of the intrusion.\n\nOn February 4, a user operating under the alias \"w1kkid\" posted a dataset containing 662,752 user records on BreachForums, a well-known cybercrime marketplace. Substack began notifying affected users the following day.\n\n## What We Know\n\n### Scope of the Breach\n\nThe leaked dataset, as reported by Hackread and CyberInsider, contains a broad range of user data [1][2]:\n\n- Email addresses and phone numbers\n- Full names, user IDs, and profile pictures\n- Biographies and newsletter handles\n- Stripe platform customer IDs\n- Account creation dates and update timestamps\n- Notification preferences and subscription metadata\n- Internal moderation flags (including admin status, ban status, and CAPTCHA verification)\n- Session version information\n\nThe inclusion of backend-only fields — such as moderation flags and Stripe customer IDs — suggests the attacker gained access to internal systems or data exports rather than scraping publicly available information, according to Hackread's analysis [1].\n\nSubstack has confirmed that passwords, payment card data, and financial information were not compromised [3].\n\n### Timeline of Events\n\n- **October 2025**: The unauthorized access occurred, exploiting a vulnerability in Substack's systems\n- **February 2, 2026**: The leaked dataset first appeared on BreachForums\n- **February 3, 2026**: Substack detected the breach internally\n- **February 4, 2026**: The threat actor \"w1kkid\" publicly claimed responsibility on BreachForums\n- **February 5, 2026**: Substack began emailing affected users and CEO Chris Best issued a notification\n\nAccording to CyberInsider, the threat actor described the data scraping activity as \"noisy,\" noting that detection occurred once the activity became apparent to Substack's systems [2].\n\n### Company Response\n\nSubstack CEO Chris Best addressed the incident directly in emails to affected users. \"I'm incredibly sorry this happened,\" Best wrote. \"We have fixed the problem with our system that allowed this to happen\" [3][5].\n\nThe company stated it is conducting a full investigation and implementing improvements to prevent future incidents. Substack emphasized it has found no evidence the stolen data is being actively misused [3].\n\nNotably, Substack chose to notify affected users via email rather than issuing a public blog post or social media announcement, a decision that drew criticism from some security researchers and journalists [3].\n\n## What We Don't Know\n\n- **The exact vulnerability exploited**: Substack has described the incident only in general terms, saying it involved \"a problem with our system\" that has since been fixed. No technical details about the attack vector have been disclosed.\n- **The precise number of affected users**: While the dark web posting contains 662,752 records, CyberInsider reports the number at closer to 697,313 [2]. Substack has not publicly stated how many users received breach notifications.\n- **Whether journalist and government records are at risk**: CyberInsider reported that sample data from the leak included records tied to journalists and government-associated email addresses, but the full extent of sensitive accounts compromised remains unclear [2].\n- **Whether the attacker maintained persistent access**: The four-month gap between initial access and detection raises questions about whether the attacker had ongoing access during that period.\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe Substack breach is relatively modest in scale compared to recent mega-breaches, but it carries outsized implications for several reasons.\n\nThe four-month detection gap is significant. The roughly 120-day window between initial access in October 2025 and discovery in February 2026 allowed ample time for the attacker to exfiltrate data and potentially map the platform's internal systems.\n\nThe nature of Substack's user base raises particular concerns. The platform hosts journalists, political commentators, whistleblowers, and independent writers — many of whom rely on pseudonymous or compartmentalized identities. The exposure of email addresses and phone numbers, combined with internal metadata like moderation flags, could facilitate targeted phishing campaigns or deanonymization efforts.\n\nThe inclusion of Stripe customer IDs — even without accompanying financial data — is notable. While these identifiers alone cannot be used to access payment information, they could theoretically be combined with other leaked data in credential-stuffing or social engineering attacks against Stripe's platform.\n\nFor users, the risk profile depends on how they use Substack. Those who rely on the platform's default \"magic link\" passwordless authentication face minimal credential-related risk. Users with optional multi-factor authentication have additional protection. Substack subscribers who receive newsletters via email without holding a Substack account are unaffected, according to CSO Online [3].\n\nThe breach marks only the second known security incident in Substack's history, following a minor email mishap in 2020 when user addresses were accidentally placed in \"cc\" rather than \"bcc\" fields [3]. The escalation from that operational error to a full system compromise underscores how Substack's security posture needs to mature alongside its growing role as critical publishing infrastructure.\n\n---\n\n**Sources:**\n\n[1] Hackread — \"Substack Breach: 662,752 User Records Leaked on Cybercrime Forum\"\n\n[2] CyberInsider — \"Substack suffers apparent data breach affecting nearly 700,000 users\"\n\n[3] CSO Online — \"Substack data breach leaks users' email addresses and phone numbers\"\n\n[4] Security Affairs — \"Hacker claims theft of data from 700,000 Substack users; Company confirms breach\"\n\n[5] The Record — \"Substack warns customers of data breach following hacker's dark web claims\""
