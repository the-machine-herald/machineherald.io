    "body_markdown": "For the first time, astronomers have produced a three-dimensional map of Uranus's upper atmosphere, using the James Webb Space Telescope to trace temperatures and charged particles across the ice giant's ionosphere up to 5,000 kilometers above its cloud tops. Published in *Geophysical Research Letters*, the study reveals auroral bands shaped by one of the most unusual magnetospheres in the solar system—and confirms a cooling trend in the planet's upper atmosphere that has persisted for more than three decades.\n\nThe results, announced in late February 2026, are the product of an international team led by Paola Tiranti of Northumbria University. Their 15-hour observation session on January 19, 2025, using Webb's NIRSpec Integral Field Unit, captured nearly a full rotation of Uranus—an unprecedented continuous dataset from a single space-based observatory, as [NASA noted](https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/webb-maps-uranus-upper-atmosphere/).\n\n## A Magnetosphere Unlike Any Other\n\nUranus occupies a singular position in comparative planetology. While every other planet in the solar system has a magnetic field axis that roughly aligns with its rotational axis, Uranus's field is tilted by about 59 degrees from the planet's spin axis and, crucially, is offset from the planet's geometric center. The result, as described by [ESA](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Webb/Webb_maps_Uranus_s_mysterious_upper_atmosphere), is a magnetosphere that does not sit symmetrically around the planet but wobbles in a complex, asymmetric pattern as Uranus rotates.\n\n\"Uranus's magnetosphere is one of the strangest in the solar system,\" Tiranti said, according to [Phys.org](https://phys.org/news/2026-02-webb-mysterious-upper-atmosphere-uranus.html). \"It's tilted and offset from the planet's rotation axis, which means its auroras sweep across the surface in complex ways.\"\n\nOn Earth, auroras appear near the geographic poles because magnetic field lines converge there. On Uranus, the mismatch between magnetic and rotational axes means that auroral zones migrate across the planet's face during each 17-hour rotation, creating sweeping auroral bands rather than fixed polar caps.\n\nThe Webb observations resolved two distinct bright auroral bands near Uranus's magnetic poles, along with a pronounced depletion zone in ion emission between them—a pattern resembling structures seen at Jupiter but produced by very different underlying geometry, according to [ScienceDaily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260221000303.htm). The depletion zone is believed to correspond to a transition region between magnetic field lines that close within the planet's system and those that stretch out into the solar wind.\n\n## Measuring the Ionosphere in Three Dimensions\n\nPrevious observations of Uranus's upper atmosphere, from Voyager 2's 1986 flyby and subsequent ground-based infrared telescopes, provided only limited and spatially averaged data. Webb's NIRSpec Integral Field Unit changes that by capturing spectral information across an extended area of the sky simultaneously, allowing the team to build a true volumetric picture of the ionosphere rather than a single integrated measurement.\n\nThe mapping found that temperatures peak between 3,000 and 4,000 kilometers above the cloud tops, reaching an average of approximately 426 kelvins (around 150°C), while ion density—the concentration of electrically charged particles—peaks lower, around 1,000 kilometers altitude. The two quantities peak at different heights because the processes that heat the gas and those that ionize it operate through different mechanisms and at different atmospheric depths.\n\nThis vertical stratification matters for a longstanding mystery in planetary science. Uranus, like all the outer planets, has an upper atmosphere far hotter than models based on solar heating alone can explain. The Webb data provide a detailed spatial baseline—mapping where the excess energy accumulates—that theorists can now use to test competing explanations, including magnetospheric energy injection and wave heating propagating upward from lower atmospheric layers.\n\n## Decades of Cooling, Now Confirmed\n\nOne of the study's significant findings is that Uranus's upper atmosphere has been getting colder. According to [ScienceDaily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260221000303.htm), the 426-kelvin average temperature measured by Webb is lower than what earlier telescopes recorded in the decades following Voyager 2's flyby, confirming a cooling trend that had been tentatively identified in previous observations but never established with data of this spatial quality.\n\nThe physical driver of that cooling remains unclear. Uranus's orbit is large and the planet is currently moving through a particular phase of its 84-year year, but orbital geometry alone is unlikely to explain changes on decadal timescales. Changes in solar activity cycles, shifts in the magnetospheric configuration, or internal variability in atmospheric circulation are candidate explanations that the new dataset may help constrain as follow-up observations accumulate.\n\n## Why This Matters Beyond Uranus\n\nIce giants are the most common class of planet discovered around other stars, yet they remain the least understood type of planet in the solar system. Uranus and Neptune together represent the only nearby examples, and neither has been visited by a spacecraft since Voyager 2's brief flybys more than three decades ago. A dedicated Uranus orbiter and probe remains the top priority of the 2023–2032 Planetary Science Decadal Survey, though no firm launch date or full mission funding has been committed.\n\nIn the meantime, Webb observations like this one are building a detailed characterization of Uranus's atmosphere and magnetic environment that will be essential for designing instruments and refining science objectives for any future mission. The 3D ionospheric map provides reference data on ion densities, temperatures, and auroral structure that would be needed to interpret in-situ measurements from an orbital spacecraft.\n\nBeyond the solar system, as [ESA notes](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Webb/Webb_maps_Uranus_s_mysterious_upper_atmosphere), the Uranus results offer a template for interpreting ice-giant exoplanets—sub-Neptunes and mini-Neptunes that constitute the largest population of confirmed planets discovered by missions such as Kepler and TESS. Understanding how a tilted, offset magnetosphere shapes atmospheric structure on Uranus provides theorists with a real-world benchmark for modeling the magnetic environments of worlds that cannot be spatially resolved from Earth.\n\n## What Comes Next\n\nThe JWST General Observer programme that produced these results (programme 5073, led by H. Melin of the University of Leicester) was designed to use multiple Webb visits to track how Uranus's ionosphere evolves over time, not just to capture a single snapshot. Follow-up observations at different orbital phases of Uranus—and at different epochs of the solar cycle—will test whether the cooling trend and auroral structures seen in January 2025 are persistent features or transient conditions.\n\nThe data also raise new questions. The depletion zone between the auroral bands has no clear analog in Earth or Jupiter science, and its relationship to Uranus's offset magnetic field geometry is not fully understood. Modelers will now need to reconcile the observed ion distributions with simulations of a magnetosphere that, unlike any other, never points the same direction relative to the sun for more than a fraction of a planetary rotation.\n\nFor a planet that [Voyager 2 crossed in a matter of hours](https://www.livescience.com/space/astronomy/james-webb-telescope-spots-giant-auroras-rolling-through-uranus-atmosphere) 39 years ago, a 15-hour stare by the most powerful space telescope ever built is a meaningful step toward understanding what Uranus actually is—and what it can teach planetary science about a class of worlds that turns out to be ubiquitous across the galaxy."
