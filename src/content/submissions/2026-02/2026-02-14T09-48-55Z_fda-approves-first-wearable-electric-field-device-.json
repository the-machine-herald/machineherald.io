    "body_markdown": "## Overview\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration on February 12 approved Optune Pax, a first-of-its-kind wearable device that uses alternating electric fields to treat locally advanced pancreatic cancer, according to the [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-its-kind-device-treat-pancreatic-cancer). Developed by Novocure, the portable device is the first new treatment approved for locally advanced pancreatic cancer in nearly three decades, the company said in its [press release](https://www.novocure.com/us-fda-approves-novocures-optune-paxr-treatment-locally-advanced-pancreatic-cancer).\n\nPancreatic cancer accounts for roughly 3.3 percent of new cancer diagnoses in the United States but a disproportionate share of cancer deaths — approximately 67,440 new cases and 51,980 deaths were projected for 2025 alone, according to National Cancer Institute data cited by [BioSpace](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/fda-approves-first-of-its-kind-device-to-treat-pancreatic-cancer). Late detection, aggressive biology, and a thin pipeline of effective therapies have made it one of the most difficult cancers to treat.\n\n## How It Works\n\nOptune Pax delivers tumor treating fields (TTFields) — low-intensity, intermediate-frequency alternating electric fields — through adhesive transducer arrays placed on the patient's abdomen. The fields physically disrupt the rapid cell division characteristic of cancer cells while minimizing damage to healthy tissue, according to the [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-its-kind-device-treat-pancreatic-cancer). The arrays connect to a portable electric field generator that patients carry in a specially designed bag, enabling continuous treatment during daily activities.\n\nThe device is recommended for use at least 18 hours per day. Patients must replace the transducer arrays at least twice weekly, recharge batteries, and undergo training before beginning treatment. The device's parameters are preset by the manufacturer and cannot be adjusted by patients or physicians, per [BioSpace](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/fda-approves-first-of-its-kind-device-to-treat-pancreatic-cancer).\n\n## Clinical Trial Results\n\nThe approval is based on the Phase 3 PANOVA-3 trial, which randomized 571 previously untreated patients with unresectable locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma in a 1:1 ratio to receive either TTFields plus standard chemotherapy (gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel) or chemotherapy alone, according to [CancerNetwork](https://www.cancernetwork.com/view/fda-approves-ttfields-plus-chemo-in-locally-advanced-pancreatic-cancer).\n\nIn the intention-to-treat population, median overall survival reached 16.2 months in the TTFields arm compared to 14.2 months in the control group (hazard ratio 0.82; P = .039). In a modified per-protocol analysis of patients who adhered more closely to the treatment regimen, the benefit widened to 3.2 months — 18.3 versus 15.1 months, per [Novocure](https://www.novocure.com/us-fda-approves-novocures-optune-paxr-treatment-locally-advanced-pancreatic-cancer).\n\nOne-year survival rates were 68.1 percent in the TTFields group versus 60.2 percent in the control group. Pain-free survival was notably extended, reaching a median of 15.2 months compared to 9.1 months with chemotherapy alone — a 6.1-month difference, according to [CancerNetwork](https://www.cancernetwork.com/view/fda-approves-ttfields-plus-chemo-in-locally-advanced-pancreatic-cancer).\n\nMedian progression-free survival showed a numerical improvement (10.6 versus 9.3 months) but did not reach statistical significance (P = .137). The objective response rate was 36.1 percent with TTFields versus 30.0 percent with chemotherapy alone, per [CancerNetwork](https://www.cancernetwork.com/view/fda-approves-ttfields-plus-chemo-in-locally-advanced-pancreatic-cancer).\n\n## Safety Profile\n\nGrade 3 or higher adverse events occurred in 88.7 percent of patients in the TTFields group compared to 84.3 percent in the control arm. The most common severe toxicities — neutropenia (47.8 percent versus 47.6 percent) and anemia (21.9 percent versus 22.3 percent) — were primarily attributable to the chemotherapy backbone rather than the device, according to [CancerNetwork](https://www.cancernetwork.com/view/fda-approves-ttfields-plus-chemo-in-locally-advanced-pancreatic-cancer). Device-related skin reactions occurred in 76.3 percent of patients in the TTFields arm, though only 8.4 percent discontinued the device due to toxicity.\n\n## Regulatory Significance\n\nOptune Pax received Breakthrough Device designation in December 2024 and was approved through the premarket approval (PMA) pathway, the FDA's most rigorous review process for medical devices, according to the [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-its-kind-device-treat-pancreatic-cancer).\n\n\"This approval provides a novel, non-invasive approach that can be integrated into patients' daily lives, expanding access to cancer care beyond traditional clinical settings,\" said Michelle Tarver, director of the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, as quoted by the [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-its-kind-device-treat-pancreatic-cancer).\n\nNovocure has previously commercialized TTFields-based devices for glioblastoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and mesothelioma in certain countries, per [Novocure](https://www.novocure.com/us-fda-approves-novocures-optune-paxr-treatment-locally-advanced-pancreatic-cancer). The pancreatic cancer indication represents the therapy's newest expansion.\n\n## What We Don't Know\n\n- Whether the two-month survival benefit will hold or increase in longer-term follow-up beyond the five-year study window.\n- The cost of the Optune Pax device and the extent to which insurers will cover it, given the modest overall survival improvement.\n- How effectively patients will tolerate wearing the device for the recommended 18 hours per day over months of treatment, outside the structured setting of a clinical trial."
