    "body_markdown": "## Overview\n\nSamsung Electronics announced on February 12 that it has begun commercial shipments of HBM4, the latest generation of high-bandwidth memory chips designed for AI accelerators. The move makes Samsung the first manufacturer to deliver HBM4 to customers, giving it a timing advantage over market leader SK Hynix, which has delayed its own HBM4 mass production to March or April 2026, according to [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-12/samsung-says-it-starts-commercial-shipment-of-hbm4-to-customer-mlj2njno). Samsung shares closed up 6.4 percent on the news, while SK Hynix rose 3.3 percent, as reported by [Reuters](https://whtc.com/2026/02/12/samsung-begins-hbm4-chip-shipments/).\n\n## What We Know\n\n### A Generational Leap in Bandwidth\n\nSamsung's HBM4 chips deliver data-processing speeds of 11.7 gigabits per second, a 22 percent increase over its HBM3E predecessor, with the company claiming a maximum speed capability of 13 Gbps, according to [Reuters](https://whtc.com/2026/02/12/samsung-begins-hbm4-chip-shipments/). Per-stack memory bandwidth reaches approximately 3 terabytes per second — roughly 2.4 times greater than HBM3E — with 48-gigabyte capacity per stack, as reported by [Dataconomy](https://dataconomy.com/2026/02/09/samsung-starts-hbm4-shipments-as-early-as-third-week-of-february/).\n\nThe chips are built on Samsung's sixth-generation 10-nanometer-class DRAM process, paired with a base logic die manufactured on its own 4-nanometer foundry process. This vertical integration — producing the logic die in-house rather than relying on external foundries like TSMC — provides Samsung with both a supply chain advantage and greater lead time over competitors, according to [TrendForce](https://www.trendforce.com/news/2026/01/26/news-samsung-reportedly-set-to-begin-official-hbm4-shipments-to-nvidia-and-amd-in-february/).\n\nSamsung CTO Song Jai-hyuk described customer feedback on HBM4 performance as \"very satisfactory,\" noting the chips passed validation without any redesign even after customers requested enhanced performance, according to [Reuters](https://whtc.com/2026/02/12/samsung-begins-hbm4-chip-shipments/) and [TrendForce](https://www.trendforce.com/news/2026/01/26/news-samsung-reportedly-set-to-begin-official-hbm4-shipments-to-nvidia-and-amd-in-february/).\n\n### Samsung's Comeback Bid\n\nThe early shipments represent a strategic inflection point for Samsung. As recently as the second quarter of 2025, Samsung had fallen to third place in the HBM market with just 17 percent share, behind SK Hynix at 62 percent and Micron at 21 percent, according to [Astute Group](https://www.astutegroup.com/news/general/sk-hynix-holds-62-of-hbm-micron-overtakes-samsung-2026-battle-pivots-to-hbm4/). By the third quarter of 2025, Samsung had recovered to 35 percent as its HBM3E qualifications progressed.\n\nSamsung now expects its HBM revenue to more than triple in 2026 and plans to expand production capacity by approximately 50 percent by year-end, reaching roughly 250,000 wafers per month from the current 170,000, according to [Dataconomy](https://dataconomy.com/2026/02/09/samsung-starts-hbm4-shipments-as-early-as-third-week-of-february/).\n\n### The NVIDIA Connection\n\nWhile Samsung did not name its customers in the announcement, the primary destination for HBM4 chips is NVIDIA's Vera Rubin AI accelerator platform, slated for launch in the second half of 2026, as reported by [Dataconomy](https://dataconomy.com/2026/02/09/samsung-starts-hbm4-shipments-as-early-as-third-week-of-february/). Samsung has also qualified HBM4 for AMD platforms, according to [TrendForce](https://www.trendforce.com/news/2026/01/26/news-samsung-reportedly-set-to-begin-official-hbm4-shipments-to-nvidia-and-amd-in-february/).\n\nHowever, industry analysts expect SK Hynix to retain the lion's share of NVIDIA's HBM4 orders once its own production ramps. According to [TrendForce](https://www.trendforce.com/news/2026/01/28/news-sk-hynix-reportedly-to-supply-about-two-thirds-of-nvidia-hbm4-samsung-targets-early-delivery/), SK Hynix is expected to supply roughly two-thirds of NVIDIA's HBM4 demand, with Samsung capturing an estimated 20 to 30 percent. SemiAnalysis projects a 70/30 split between SK Hynix and Samsung for NVIDIA's Vera Rubin platform, as cited by [WCCFTech](https://wccftech.com/the-memory-industry-is-at-a-turning-point-with-hbm4/).\n\n### Micron Faces a Steeper Climb\n\nThe competitive picture is bleaker for Micron, which held 21 percent of the overall HBM market but faces technical challenges with its HBM4 base die, including thermal issues and lower pin speeds. Micron is targeting the second quarter of 2026 for NVIDIA qualification after a redesign, according to [WCCFTech](https://wccftech.com/the-memory-industry-is-at-a-turning-point-with-hbm4/). Initial Vera Rubin allocations may exclude Micron entirely, though the company is developing HBM4E variants with foundry partners and projects an $8 billion annualized revenue run rate for 2026 HBM sales, as reported by [Astute Group](https://www.astutegroup.com/news/general/sk-hynix-holds-62-of-hbm-micron-overtakes-samsung-2026-battle-pivots-to-hbm4/).\n\n## What We Don't Know\n\nSamsung has not disclosed pricing for its HBM4 chips or the volume of initial shipments. The precise timeline for full-scale supply — expected around June 2026, according to [TrendForce](https://www.trendforce.com/news/2026/01/26/news-samsung-reportedly-set-to-begin-official-hbm4-shipments-to-nvidia-and-amd-in-february/) — depends on customer production schedules that have not been publicly confirmed.\n\nThe broader question of whether memory bandwidth or compute capacity will prove to be the more binding constraint on AI scaling remains open. HBM4 dramatically increases per-stack bandwidth, but whether the AI industry's insatiable demand for memory will outstrip even expanded production capacity is difficult to forecast. Samsung has signaled plans for HBM4E samples in the second half of 2026, suggesting the generational treadmill shows no signs of slowing.\n\nFinally, it remains unclear how much of Samsung's early shipping advantage will translate into lasting market share gains once SK Hynix begins its own HBM4 deliveries, given that SK Hynix has pledged to maintain what it calls an \"overwhelming\" market position in next-generation memory."
