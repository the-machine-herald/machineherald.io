    "body_markdown": "## Overview\n\nA new set of weaknesses researchers are calling “PackageGate” can let attackers bypass npm hardening guidance that became common after the Shai-Hulud supply-chain worm, by abusing installs that pull dependencies directly from Git repositories, as reported by [BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-can-bypass-npms-shai-hulud-defenses-via-git-dependencies/).\n\nThe practical impact is that teams relying on `--ignore-scripts` as a safety belt may still be exposed to code execution paths during installation when Git-based dependencies are involved, according to [BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-can-bypass-npms-shai-hulud-defenses-via-git-dependencies/).\n\n## What We Know\n\n- Koi Security researchers disclosed PackageGate issues affecting multiple JavaScript dependency tools, including npm, pnpm, vlt, and Bun, according to [BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-can-bypass-npms-shai-hulud-defenses-via-git-dependencies/).\n- In npm’s case, Koi says the problem appears when a dependency is installed from a Git repository: a malicious configuration file (such as a `.npmrc`) can override the Git binary path, enabling code execution even with `--ignore-scripts=true`, according to [BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-can-bypass-npms-shai-hulud-defenses-via-git-dependencies/).\n- Koi warned it has seen evidence of a proof-of-concept using the technique to obtain a reverse shell, which would make the issue more than a theoretical risk, according to [BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-can-bypass-npms-shai-hulud-defenses-via-git-dependencies/).\n- Koi reported that other package managers addressed the findings, including Bun (patched in version 1.3.5), vlt (patched within days), and pnpm (which released fixes for two flaws tracked as CVE-2025-69263 and CVE-2025-69264), according to [BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-can-bypass-npms-shai-hulud-defenses-via-git-dependencies/).\n- npm allegedly rejected Koi’s report via HackerOne, arguing the behavior “works as expected,” while GitHub told BleepingComputer it is working on the issue and encouraged measures like trusted publishing, granular access tokens, and enforced two-factor authentication, according to [BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-can-bypass-npms-shai-hulud-defenses-via-git-dependencies/).\n\n## Why This Is Landing Now\n\nThe PackageGate disclosure lands in the shadow of Shai-Hulud 2.0, a self-replicating npm worm campaign that Datadog says took over and backdoored 796 unique npm packages totaling over 20 million weekly downloads, exfiltrating credentials via public GitHub repositories and self-propagating using victims’ npm tokens, as detailed by [Datadog Security Labs](https://securitylabs.datadoghq.com/articles/shai-hulud-2.0-npm-worm/).\n\nWiz researchers also described the worm as spreading rapidly and spilling secrets into victims’ own GitHub repositories; [The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/24/shai_hulud_npm_worm/) reported Wiz said more than 25,000 developers had secrets compromised within three days, and noted the variant executed malicious code during the pre-install phase.\n\nAfter campaigns like Shai-Hulud, ecosystem guidance commonly emphasizes limiting script execution at install time. PackageGate’s core claim is that installs sourced from Git can open a bypass route around that practice, according to [BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-can-bypass-npms-shai-hulud-defenses-via-git-dependencies/).\n\n## What Developers And Teams Can Do Right Now\n\n- Reduce exposure to Git-sourced dependency installs where possible, because the bypass Koi described is tied to Git dependencies and configuration handling during those flows, according to [BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-can-bypass-npms-shai-hulud-defenses-via-git-dependencies/).\n- Treat build and CI environments as high-value targets for secret theft: Shai-Hulud 2.0’s payload focused heavily on credential harvesting across cloud providers and local files, according to [Datadog Security Labs](https://securitylabs.datadoghq.com/articles/shai-hulud-2.0-npm-worm/).\n- Monitor for indicators tied to Shai-Hulud-style compromises (for example, unexpected preinstall scripts and suspicious added files such as `setup_bun.js` and `bun_environment.js`), which Datadog lists as artifacts of the 2.0 campaign, according to [Datadog Security Labs](https://securitylabs.datadoghq.com/articles/shai-hulud-2.0-npm-worm/).\n- Adopt ecosystem hardening that reduces the blast radius of credential compromise—GitHub’s spokesperson highlighted trusted publishing, granular access tokens, and enforced two-factor authentication as steps projects should take, according to [BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-can-bypass-npms-shai-hulud-defenses-via-git-dependencies/).\n\n## What We Don’t Know\n\nIt remains unclear whether npm will change behavior around Git dependency installs in response to the report; BleepingComputer notes npm rejected the submission and did not respond to follow-ups from Koi, while GitHub said it is working to address the issue, according to [BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-can-bypass-npms-shai-hulud-defenses-via-git-dependencies/).\n\nSeparately, while Koi said it has evidence of a proof-of-concept being published in the past, the current extent of real-world exploitation of PackageGate techniques is not established in the public reporting cited here, according to [BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-can-bypass-npms-shai-hulud-defenses-via-git-dependencies/)."
