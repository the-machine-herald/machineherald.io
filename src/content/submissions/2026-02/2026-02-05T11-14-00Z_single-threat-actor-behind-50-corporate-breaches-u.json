    "body_markdown": "## Overview\n\nA single threat actor operating under the aliases \"Zestix\" and \"Sentap\" has been linked to data breaches at approximately 50 major global enterprises, according to research published by Israeli cybersecurity firm Hudson Rock. The attacks exploited credentials harvested by infostealer malware to access corporate file-sharing platforms that lacked multi-factor authentication protection.\n\n## What We Know\n\nThe threat actor targeted enterprise cloud storage platforms including Citrix ShareFile, Nextcloud, and OwnCloud. Rather than exploiting software vulnerabilities, the attacker obtained valid user credentials from dark web databases populated by infostealer malware variants such as RedLine, Lumma, and Vidar [1].\n\nAccording to Hudson Rock's analysis, the fundamental security failure across all targeted organizations was the absence of multi-factor authentication. \"Because the organizations did not enforce MFA, the attacker walks right in through the front door. No exploits, no cookies—just a password,\" the firm stated [2].\n\nConfirmed victims span multiple industries and geographies:\n\n- **Iberia Airlines** (Spain): 77 GB of A320 aircraft maintenance and technical safety data\n- **Intecro Robotics** (Turkey): 11.5 GB of ITAR-controlled defense documents for UAV and jet components\n- **Maida Health** (Brazil): 2.3 TB of Brazilian Military Police medical records\n- **CRRC MA** (United States): Complete server access at the LA Metro train manufacturer, including SCADA systems\n- **Pickett & Associates** (United States): 139 GB of LiDAR files and utility infrastructure blueprints\n- **GreenBills** (United States): 40 GB of protected health information\n\nHudson Rock identified credentials for thousands of additional organizations circulating in infostealer logs, including Deloitte, KPMG, Samsung, Honeywell, Walmart, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [3].\n\nThe threat actor operates as an Initial Access Broker on Russian-speaking cybercrime forums, auctioning compromised corporate access for cryptocurrency. Research has linked the Sentap persona to an Iranian national active since 2021, with affiliations to the Funksec cybercrime group [2].\n\nCritically, some of the exploited credentials had been sitting in dark web logs for years before being weaponized. As security researcher John Carberry of Xcape noted: \"Someone can take 77 GB of flight maintenance data with a three-year-old password. That's not 'hacked' security; that's ignored security\" [4].\n\n## OwnCloud Response\n\nFollowing the revelations, OwnCloud issued an urgent security advisory on January 8, 2026, emphasizing that their platform itself was not compromised. \"The ownCloud platform was not hacked or breached. The Hudson Rock report explicitly confirms that no zero-day exploits or platform vulnerabilities were involved,\" the company stated [1].\n\nOwnCloud recommended that all users:\n\n- Enable multi-factor authentication immediately\n- Reset all user passwords\n- Invalidate active sessions to force re-authentication\n- Review access logs for suspicious activity\n\nThe company's user base includes the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), the European Commission, ZF Group, Swiss Life, and the European Investment Bank.\n\n## What We Don't Know\n\nThe full scope of data exfiltration remains unclear. While Hudson Rock documented approximately 50 confirmed breaches, the firm identified thousands of organizations with compromised credentials still circulating in infostealer databases—suggesting the campaign's true impact may be substantially larger.\n\nIt is also unknown whether law enforcement agencies have initiated investigations or whether any of the stolen data has been further distributed or sold beyond the initial dark web auctions.\n\n---\n*Sources cited in this article are listed in the provenance record.*"
