    "body_markdown": "## Overview\n\nModerna and Merck have reported five-year follow-up data from their Phase 2b KEYNOTE-942 trial showing that intismeran autogene — a personalized mRNA cancer vaccine encoding up to 34 patient-specific neoantigens — combined with Merck's checkpoint inhibitor Keytruda (pembrolizumab), reduced the risk of melanoma recurrence or death by 49% compared to Keytruda alone [1]. The results, announced in January 2026, mark the longest follow-up to date for a personalized mRNA cancer vaccine in a randomized clinical trial.\n\n## What We Know\n\nThe KEYNOTE-942 trial enrolled 157 patients with completely resected high-risk stage III/IV melanoma, randomized 2:1 to receive intismeran autogene plus Keytruda or Keytruda alone. The vaccine was administered at 1 mg every three weeks for nine doses, alongside Keytruda at 200 mg every three weeks for up to approximately one year [1][2].\n\nKey findings from the pre-planned five-year analysis:\n\n- **Recurrence-free survival (RFS):** The combination reduced the risk of recurrence or death by 49% (hazard ratio 0.510; 95% CI 0.294–0.887; one-sided nominal p=0.0075) [1].\n- **Durability:** The hazard ratio has remained essentially stable across multiple timepoints — from 44% risk reduction at two years to 49% at both three and five years — suggesting durable immune reprogramming rather than a waning effect [1][3].\n- **Safety:** No new or unexpected late-onset toxicities were identified. The most common adverse events were fatigue, injection-site pain, and pyrexia, consistent with mRNA platforms and anti-PD-1 therapy [2].\n\nAccording to Merck SVP of Oncology Marjorie Green, \"Demonstrating the longer-term potential of intismeran autogene and pembrolizumab to reduce recurrence risk represents a meaningful milestone\" [1]. Kyle Holen, Moderna SVP of Development, noted that the data \"highlight the potential of prolonged benefit\" for this approach [1].\n\n## How the Vaccine Works\n\nUnlike traditional vaccines that target infectious agents, intismeran autogene is manufactured individually for each patient. After tumor resection, the patient's cancer is sequenced to identify unique mutations (neoantigens). The vaccine then encodes up to 34 of these neoantigens in a single mRNA construct, training the patient's T cells to recognize and attack any remaining cancer cells carrying those specific mutations [1].\n\nThis personalized approach, combined with Keytruda's ability to remove the immune system's \"brakes\" on T-cell activity, aims to create a two-pronged anti-tumor response. The stability of the hazard ratio over five years suggests this immune education persists long after treatment ends [2][3].\n\n## What We Don't Know\n\n- **Overall survival data** have not yet been disclosed. While recurrence-free survival is a validated surrogate endpoint, overall survival remains the gold standard in oncology trials.\n- **Distant metastasis-free survival** was measured as a secondary endpoint but full results have not been published [2].\n- **Pricing and access** remain unclear. Personalized mRNA vaccines require individual tumor sequencing and custom manufacturing within weeks, which analysts suggest could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per patient [3].\n- **Phase 3 confirmation** is still pending. The global Phase 3 INTerpath-001 trial in adjuvant melanoma is fully enrolled with 1,089 patients, with interim data potentially expected later in 2026. Analysts at William Blair project potential regulatory approvals by 2026 or 2027, contingent on these results [3].\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe sustained five-year efficacy of intismeran autogene represents a significant milestone for personalized cancer immunotherapy. The fact that the hazard ratio has not degraded over time suggests the vaccine may successfully reprogram the adaptive immune system for long-term tumor surveillance — a qualitatively different mechanism from conventional adjuvant treatments.\n\nThe broader implications extend well beyond melanoma. Moderna and Merck are currently running eight Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials across multiple tumor types, including non-small cell lung cancer (two Phase 3 studies enrolling), renal cell carcinoma, and bladder cancer [1]. If the melanoma results are confirmed in Phase 3 and replicated in other solid tumors, mRNA-based individualized neoantigen therapy could reshape the adjuvant treatment landscape.\n\nCompetitors including BioNTech and Gritstone are pursuing similar neoantigen approaches, but the Moderna-Merck partnership holds a significant lead in clinical data maturity [3]. The mRNA manufacturing platform, refined during the COVID-19 pandemic, provides an established infrastructure for rapid, individualized production.\n\nHowever, challenges remain. Manufacturing scalability, cost containment, and equitable access will determine whether personalized mRNA cancer vaccines can move from breakthrough trials to routine clinical practice. The Phase 3 data expected later this year will be the next critical inflection point.\n\n---\n*Sources cited in this article are listed in the provenance record.*"
