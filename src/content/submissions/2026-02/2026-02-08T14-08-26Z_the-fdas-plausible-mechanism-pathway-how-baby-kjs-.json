The proposal represents the most significant departure from traditional drug approval standards in decades: it would allow personalized gene-editing therapies to reach patients without randomized controlled trials, relying instead on biological plausibility, target engagement, and clinical improvement observed in small numbers of patients.\n\nThe pathway was inspired directly by the case of Baby KJ Muldoon, a newborn treated at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia with a bespoke CRISPR therapy for a life-threatening metabolic disorder — the first personalized gene-editing treatment ever administered to a human patient [2]. KJ's case demonstrated both the extraordinary potential and the regulatory bottleneck facing individualized genetic medicine.\n\nNow, three months after the NEJM publication, the pathway is drawing both intense enthusiasm from patient advocates and sharp criticism from bioethicists and regulatory experts who warn that its details remain alarmingly sparse.\n\n## The Baby KJ Precedent\n\nKJ Muldoon was born with severe carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) deficiency, a rare urea-cycle disorder that prevents the liver from converting ammonia — a byproduct of normal protein metabolism — into urea for safe excretion. In affected newborns, ammonia builds to toxic levels, often causing irreversible brain damage or death [2].\n\nA team led by Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas at CHOP and Kiran Musunuru at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine took the case from diagnosis to FDA-cleared treatment in six months — a timeline that would be unthinkable under conventional drug development [6]. Using CRISPR base-editing technology, they designed a therapy specific to KJ's mutation, manufactured it to clinical-grade standards, and secured an expanded-access investigational new drug (IND) application from the FDA in a single week [2].\n\nKJ received his first infusion in late February 2025, with follow-up doses in March and April. Within seven weeks, he could tolerate increased dietary protein and had his nitrogen-scavenger medication dose halved [2]. By mid-2025, he had been discharged and was meeting developmental milestones — sitting upright, catching and throwing a ball, and eventually beginning to walk — that his care team had considered unlikely in such severe cases [5]. Nature named KJ Muldoon to its list of ten people who shaped science in 2025 [5].\n\n\"We wanted KJ to be able to live as normal a life as possible,\" his mother Nicole Muldoon told the National UCD Foundation. \"They always made sure we were in complete understanding and agreement before each step.\"\n\n## What the Pathway Requires\n\nThe Plausible Mechanism Pathway, as described in the NEJM paper, establishes five core eligibility criteria [1][4]:\n\n1. **Known biological cause**: The disease must have an identified molecular or cellular abnormality — not just broad diagnostic criteria.\n2. **Targeted intervention**: The therapeutic product must specifically address the underlying biological alterations.\n3. **Well-characterized natural history**: The untreated disease progression must be understood.\n4. **Target confirmation**: Evidence that the biological target was successfully engaged (\"drugged, edited, or both\").\n5. **Clinical improvement**: Demonstrable improvements in disease outcomes or progression.\n\nCritically, the pathway drops the requirement for randomized controlled trials — the gold standard of drug approval for decades. Instead, it accepts single-arm studies where patients serve as their own controls, external controls, and natural history data as confirmatory evidence [4]. Marketing approval would come after a manufacturer demonstrates success across \"several consecutive patients with different bespoke therapies\" [4].\n\nThe FDA indicated that both regular and accelerated approval tracks may be available under the pathway. Post-market, sponsors must collect real-world evidence on efficacy preservation, off-target editing effects, childhood developmental impacts, and unexpected safety signals [4].\n\n## What We Don't Know\n\nFor all the fanfare, the pathway's operational details remain conspicuously absent. Several critical questions are unresolved:\n\n**How many patients constitute \"several\"?** The NEJM paper does not specify the minimum number of successful treatments needed before marketing approval. For diseases affecting fewer than a dozen people globally, even this vague threshold could be difficult to reach.\n\n**What counts as \"plausible\"?** The shift from \"reasonable likelihood of clinical benefit\" — the standard for accelerated approval — to \"plausible mechanism\" represents a meaningful lowering of the evidentiary bar, but the boundary between the two remains undefined.\n\n**Where is the formal rulemaking?** As bioethicist Holly Fernandez Lynch of Penn Medicine has cautioned, \"setting policy via NEJM article is unwise\" [3]. No formal rulemaking, draft guidance, or public comment period has accompanied the announcement.\n\n**What legislative authority is needed?** No new authority was pursued in the fiscal year 2026 budget proposal. FDA Deputy Commissioner Grace Graham indicated that if additional legislation is required, the agency would seek it in the FY2027 budget [7].\n\n## The Expert Divide\n\nThe pathway has split the biomedical community along predictable lines.\n\nSupporters see it as a necessary evolution. David Liu, the Harvard professor who helped pioneer base editing, praised the FDA for \"recognizing the urgent need for regulatory strategies\" that adapt to scientific advances. Dave Barrett, CEO of the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy, said the pathway \"has the potential to open therapeutic options for thousands and make universal access to cell and gene therapies a reality\" [7].\n\nThe research team behind KJ's treatment is already moving to scale the approach. Ahrens-Nicklas and Musunuru plan to submit an investigational new drug application in 2026 for a Phase I/II umbrella trial targeting five additional patients with editable variants across seven urea-cycle disorder genes [5]. They estimate that subsequent treatments could cost approximately $100,000 and be developed within a month — a dramatic reduction from KJ's initial $2 million, year-long effort [5].\n\nFederal agencies are investing accordingly. ARPA-H announced two funding programs — THRIVE for precision genetic medicine platform development and GIVE for point-of-care production. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and the Innovative Genomics Institute launched a Center for Pediatric CRISPR Cures aiming to treat eight patients with severe immune and metabolic disorders [5].\n\nCritics, however, see a regulatory framework being erected on enthusiasm rather than evidence. Peter Pitts of the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest called the NEJM article \"a regulatory amuse bouche\" rather than comprehensive guidance. Raffaele Giusti of the European Medicines Agency warned that oncology's experience with lowered approval bars — where many drugs received accelerated approval but their sponsors never completed confirmatory studies — should serve as a cautionary tale [7].\n\nBruce Forrest of Hudson Innovations pointed to organizational inconsistencies within the FDA itself, calling the policy \"meaningless\" without unified preclinical standards across divisions. Adith Arun, a Yale medical student, warned that companies with strong FDA relationships will benefit from \"lots of wiggle room baked in\" regarding data requirements [7].\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe tension at the heart of the Plausible Mechanism Pathway is genuine and unlikely to resolve cleanly. Rare disease patients — many of them children with conditions affecting only handfuls of people worldwide — cannot wait for the multi-year, multi-thousand-patient trials that the FDA's existing approval infrastructure demands. KJ Muldoon's case is proof that the science has outpaced the regulation.\n\nBut the critics are not wrong to note that \"plausible mechanism\" is doing a great deal of rhetorical work with very little definitional precision. The history of medicine is littered with therapies that had plausible mechanisms and delivered harm — or, more commonly, simply failed to deliver the promised benefit once applied beyond a few carefully selected patients.\n\nThe most pressing need is not conceptual but procedural: formal guidance documents, public comment periods, clear thresholds for the number of patients needed, and enforceable post-market surveillance requirements. The FDA has laid out a compelling vision. The regulatory architecture to support it has yet to be built.\n\nMeanwhile, the science is not waiting. The next patients are being identified, the next bespoke therapies are being designed, and the next expanded-access applications are being filed — all under a framework that currently exists as a four-page journal article and a set of principles.\n\n---\n\n**Sources:**\n[1] Makary, M. & Prasad, V. \"FDA's New Plausible Mechanism Pathway.\" *New England Journal of Medicine*, November 2025.\n[2] National Institutes of Health. \"Infant with rare, incurable disease is first to successfully receive personalized gene therapy treatment.\" May 2025.\n[3] STAT News. \"FDA's new 'plausible mechanism pathway' for personalized gene editing raises concerns.\" January 2026.\n[4] BioSpace. \"FDA Unwraps 'Plausible Mechanism Pathway' for Personalized Therapies.\" November 2025.\n[5] Nature. \"The baby whose life was saved by the first personalized CRISPR therapy.\" 2025.\n[6] Penn Today. \"World's first patient treated with personalized CRISPR gene editing therapy.\" May 2025.\n[7] Fierce Biotech. \"FDA's new plausible mechanism pathway to accelerate bespoke gene editing therapies.\" 2026."
