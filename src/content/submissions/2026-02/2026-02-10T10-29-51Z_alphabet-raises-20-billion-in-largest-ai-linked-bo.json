    "body_markdown": "## Overview\n\nAlphabet Inc. has launched a sprawling multi-currency debt offering that marks a watershed moment in corporate finance. The Google parent company raised $20 billion through a seven-tranche US dollar bond sale on Monday, far exceeding its initial $15 billion target, after attracting more than $100 billion in investor orders, as reported by [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-09/alphabet-s-dollar-bond-sale-draws-over-100-billion-of-demand). The company is simultaneously selling sterling and Swiss franc bonds for the first time, including an ultra-rare 100-year note that represents the first century bond issued by a technology company since Motorola in 1997, according to [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-09/alphabet-mandates-banks-for-rare-100-year-sterling-bond).\n\nThe proceeds will fund what Alphabet has projected to be between $175 billion and $185 billion in capital expenditures for 2026, more than double its 2025 investment of $91.4 billion, as the company races to build AI data centers and infrastructure at a scale that has no precedent in corporate history.\n\n## The Offering\n\nThe dollar-denominated portion alone made this one of the largest corporate bond sales in recent memory. According to [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-09/alphabet-set-to-raise-20-billion-from-us-dollar-bond-sale), Alphabet structured the US deal across seven tranches, with the longest-dated portion maturing in 2066. Initial pricing discussions for that tranche began at approximately 120 basis points above US Treasuries, but overwhelming demand tightened spreads to 95 basis points — a clear signal of investor confidence in Alphabet's credit.\n\nThe order book reaching $100 billion, roughly five times the offering size, places it among the strongest demand levels ever recorded for a corporate bond deal. JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Bank of America coordinated the US dollar offering, while Deutsche Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, and Wells Fargo managed the sterling and Swiss franc tranches.\n\nBeyond the dollar sale, Alphabet is issuing sterling-denominated bonds with maturities ranging from three to 100 years and Swiss franc bonds spanning three to 25 years, as reported by [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-10/alphabet-begins-selling-multi-tranche-debut-swiss-franc-bond-mlgb76p8). This marks Alphabet's debut in both currencies. The sterling century bond, maturing in 2126, locks in long-term capital while providing natural hedging against Alphabet's substantial UK and European revenue streams.\n\n## The AI Spending Surge\n\nThe bond sale cannot be understood in isolation. Alphabet disclosed capital expenditure guidance of $175 billion to $185 billion for 2026, as reported by [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/04/alphabet-resets-the-bar-for-ai-infrastructure-spending.html). The figure exceeded Wall Street expectations by a wide margin — analysts had projected roughly $120 billion. Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak has projected that Alphabet's annual spending could reach $250 billion by 2027.\n\nThe spending is aimed at data centers, subsea cables, custom AI chips such as Google's Tensor Processing Units, and GPU clusters needed to train and serve generative AI models. Alphabet is not alone in this debt-fueled infrastructure race. According to [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/06/google-microsoft-meta-amazon-ai-cash.html), combined AI infrastructure spending among the five major hyperscalers — Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and Oracle — is approaching $700 billion in 2026. Corporate bond issuance by these companies surged to $121 billion in 2025, compared to an annual average of just $28 billion between 2020 and 2024. Meta raised $30 billion in a single offering last October, while Oracle sought $18 billion in September.\n\nAlphabet itself returned to the debt markets in November 2025, raising $17.5 billion in US dollar bonds and €6.5 billion in European markets. The current offering, less than three months later, underscores the velocity at which these companies are consuming capital.\n\n## The Century Bond Gamble\n\nThe 100-year sterling note is the most symbolically charged element of the deal. Century bonds are vanishingly rare. In the sterling market, only a handful of entities have ever issued them, including the University of Oxford, EDF, and the Wellcome Trust, the most recent of which came in 2018. In the technology sector, the last comparable issuance was Motorola's 1997 century bond, followed by IBM's in 1996.\n\nThe Motorola comparison has drawn pointed commentary. Investor Michael Burry, known for his role in the 2008 financial crisis depicted in *The Big Short*, noted that Motorola was the most valuable corporate brand in America the year it issued its century bond, according to [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-09/alphabet-mandates-banks-for-rare-100-year-sterling-bond). By 1998, Nokia had overtaken it in mobile phone market share. After the iPhone arrived, Motorola's consumer business collapsed. The company now ranks 232nd by market capitalization with roughly $11 billion in annual sales.\n\nAlphabet's financial position is, by any measure, stronger than Motorola's was in 1997. The company holds more than $100 billion in cash, equivalents, and marketable securities. Its annual revenue exceeded $400 billion in 2025. It carries credit ratings of Aa2 from Moody's and AA+ from S&P Global. Yet Burry's broader point — that peak corporate confidence often precedes disruption — resonates with investors who recognize that no technology company has maintained dominance for a century without radical transformation.\n\n## What We Don't Know\n\nSeveral significant questions remain unanswered. The specific yield on the century bond has not been publicly disclosed, and its pricing will reveal how much premium investors demand for lending to a technology company across a 100-year horizon.\n\nWhether AI revenue growth will justify $175 billion to $185 billion in annual infrastructure spending remains uncertain. While generative AI products are growing rapidly across Google Cloud, Search, and other divisions, the gap between AI capital deployed and AI revenue realized is widening industry-wide. Alphabet itself flagged new AI-related risks in its bond prospectus, according to [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/09/alphabet-highlights-new-ai-related-risks-in-tapping-debt-market.html), an unusual acknowledgment from a company typically cautious in its public disclosures.\n\nThe sustainability of this spending trajectory also warrants scrutiny. If Morgan Stanley's projection of $250 billion by 2027 proves accurate, Alphabet would be spending at a rate that exceeds the GDP of many nations on infrastructure alone.\n\n## Analysis\n\nAlphabet's bond sale is a statement of intent. By borrowing at historic scale, across three currencies, and at a maturity that extends to 2126, the company is signaling that it views AI infrastructure investment not as a cyclical bet but as a generational commitment.\n\nThe overwhelming demand — $100 billion in orders for a $20 billion offering — suggests the market broadly agrees, at least for now. Pension funds and insurance companies, in particular, are drawn to ultra-long-dated assets that match their own liability profiles. Alphabet's elite credit rating provides the ballast these institutional buyers require.\n\nBut the deal also crystallizes a tension running through the technology sector. The same companies reporting record revenues are simultaneously signaling that they need to borrow tens of billions to stay competitive in an AI arms race with no clear finish line. The shift from self-funded expansion to large-scale debt issuance is a structural change in how Big Tech finances its growth, and it introduces balance sheet risk to companies that previously operated with negligible leverage.\n\nMotorola's century bond matured uneventfully — the company survived long enough to honor it, though in a form unrecognizable to its 1997 self. Whether anyone will remember this particular Alphabet bond in 2126 is, by definition, unknowable. What is knowable is that the company is betting an extraordinary sum on AI, and the bond market, for now, is happy to let it."
