    "body_markdown": "## Overview\n\nAmazon reported fourth-quarter 2025 net sales of $213.39 billion on February 5, 2026, beating analyst estimates and delivering 14% year-over-year growth [2]. Full-year revenue reached a record $716.9 billion, up 12% from the prior year [2]. Amazon Web Services grew 24% to $35.58 billion in the quarter — its fastest expansion in 13 quarters [2][3].\n\nYet Amazon shares plunged approximately 8% in after-hours trading after the company disclosed plans to spend roughly $200 billion in capital expenditures during 2026 [2][5]. The figure exceeds analyst consensus by $51 billion and surpasses Alphabet's already-startling $175-185 billion capex guidance by a wide margin, making Amazon's spending plan the largest of any technology company in history [3]. The earnings miss — $1.95 per share versus the $1.97 consensus — compounded investor unease [2].\n\n## The Numbers\n\n### Revenue and Profitability\n\nAmazon's Q4 results were broadly strong across segments. Operating income reached $24.98 billion, up from $21.2 billion in the prior year, with an overall operating margin of 11.7% [5].\n\nBy segment [2]:\n\n- **North America:** $127.1 billion (+10% YoY), with operating income of $11.5 billion\n- **International:** $50.7 billion (+17% YoY), with operating income of $1.0 billion\n- **AWS:** $35.58 billion (+24% YoY), with operating income of $12.47 billion at a 35% margin\n\nAWS generated more operating profit than the rest of Amazon combined, underscoring the cloud division's role as the company's profit engine [3]. Custom AI chips achieved a $10 billion-plus annual revenue run rate with triple-digit year-over-year growth [2].\n\nAdvertising revenue grew 22% year-over-year [2]. Thursday Night Football averaged over 15 million viewers, up 16%, with the Bears-Packers playoff game reaching 31 million viewers — a new NFL streaming record [2].\n\n### The $200 Billion Question\n\nThe capex guidance dominated the earnings narrative. CEO Andy Jassy stated: \"Most of it is in AI, and we just have a lot of growth, a lot of demand\" [3]. He added that with \"seminal opportunities like AI, chips, robotics, low earth orbit satellites, we expect to invest about $200 billion in capital expenditures across Amazon in 2026\" [1].\n\nFor context, AWS added approximately 4 gigawatts of computing capacity in 2025. Jassy indicated the company expects to double capacity again by the end of 2027 [3]. Amazon also secured a $38 billion infrastructure commitment from OpenAI, positioning AWS as a primary compute provider for major AI developers [3].\n\n### Forward Guidance\n\nAmazon projected Q1 2026 revenue of $173.5 billion to $178.5 billion, representing 11-15% year-over-year growth and roughly in line with the analyst estimate of $175.52 billion [2][5].\n\n## The Workforce Equation\n\nThe earnings report arrives weeks after Amazon announced it would cut approximately 16,000 roles across the company — the second major round of layoffs in four months, following 14,000 cuts in October 2025 [4]. Combined, Amazon has eliminated roughly 30,000 corporate positions since October.\n\nJassy framed the reductions as part of an organizational overhaul aimed at \"reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy\" [4]. The juxtaposition is stark: Amazon is simultaneously planning to spend over half a billion dollars per day on infrastructure while cutting tens of thousands of employees.\n\n## The Big Tech Capex Arms Race\n\nAmazon's disclosure completes a picture of extraordinary spending commitments from the largest technology companies. In the span of one week, three of the Magnificent Seven have announced 2026 capex plans that collectively approach $600 billion:\n\n| Company | 2026 Capex Guidance | 2025 Capex | Increase |\n|---------|-------------------|------------|----------|\n| Amazon | ~$200B | ~$100B | ~100% |\n| Alphabet | $175-185B | $91.4B | ~97% |\n| Meta | $60-65B* | $39B | ~62% |\n\n*Meta's figure is from earlier guidance; the company has not yet reported Q4 2025 earnings.\n\nThe combined spending represents an unprecedented corporate investment cycle. Amazon's $200 billion alone exceeds the GDP of more than 140 countries and is roughly equivalent to the entire global semiconductor industry's annual revenue.\n\n## What We Don't Know\n\n- **Capex breakdown:** Amazon has not disclosed how the $200 billion splits between AWS data centers, logistics automation, Project Kuiper satellite infrastructure, and other initiatives. The \"most of it is in AI\" characterization from Jassy lacks precision.\n- **Return timeline:** When these investments will begin generating returns commensurate with their scale remains unaddressed. AWS's current 35% operating margin could face pressure as massive new capacity comes online ahead of demand.\n- **AWS versus competitors:** AWS's 24% growth, while its fastest in 13 quarters, trails Google Cloud's 48% expansion and Microsoft Azure's 39% growth [3]. Whether the spending gap will close this competitive gap is unclear.\n- **Workforce trajectory:** Jassy has acknowledged that AI is expected to reduce Amazon's total corporate workforce over time, but has not provided specific projections for how many additional roles may be affected.\n\n## Analysis\n\nAmazon's earnings call crystallizes the central tension in Big Tech: the companies generating the most profit from the current technology cycle are being compelled to reinvest it at rates that compress near-term returns. AWS produced $12.47 billion in operating profit in a single quarter — and Amazon is planning to spend that figure roughly every 23 days on capital expenditures in 2026.\n\nThe competitive dynamics explain the urgency. AWS remains the largest cloud provider by revenue, but it is growing slower than both Google Cloud and Azure in percentage terms. The $38 billion OpenAI commitment provides a marquee anchor customer, but it also reveals the stakes: if AWS cannot attract and retain the largest AI workloads, the infrastructure investment becomes stranded capacity.\n\nThe layoff arithmetic is equally telling. Eliminating 30,000 corporate employees at an estimated average cost of $150,000-200,000 per employee saves roughly $4.5-6 billion annually — meaningful, but less than 3% of the planned capex. The reductions appear driven less by direct cost savings and more by a strategic reallocation: fewer corporate employees, more data center infrastructure.\n\nFor investors, the question is whether the AI infrastructure buildout follows the pattern of AWS's original expansion in the 2000s and 2010s, when heavy upfront investment eventually produced the most profitable division in Amazon's history. The difference is scale: AWS was built over a decade with cumulative investment in the tens of billions. Amazon is now proposing to spend $200 billion in a single year.\n\nThe market's 8% after-hours decline suggests investors are not uniformly convinced that demand will materialize to justify this level of spending. But Amazon — like Alphabet, Meta, and Microsoft — appears to have concluded that the cost of under-investing in AI infrastructure exceeds the cost of over-investing. In the current competitive environment, the companies that build capacity will either capture a generational platform shift or write off the largest capital expenditures in corporate history. There is very little middle ground.\n\n---\n\n*Sources cited in this article are listed in the provenance record.*"
