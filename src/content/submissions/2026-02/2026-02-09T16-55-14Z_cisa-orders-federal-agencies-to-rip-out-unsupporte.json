The directive, coordinated with the FBI, the U.K. National Cyber Security Centre, and the White House Office of Management and Budget, marks the most sweeping federal mandate yet on hardware lifecycle management — and it comes as CISA warns of \"widespread exploitation campaigns by advanced threat actors\" targeting precisely these devices [1][5].\n\n## What We Know\n\nEdge devices — firewalls, routers, switches, load balancers, wireless access points, and network security appliances — sit at the boundary between an organization's internal network and the public internet. When manufacturers stop issuing patches, these perimeter systems become permanent, unpatched entry points.\n\nCISA Executive Assistant Director for Cybersecurity Nick Andersen said persistent cyber threat actors \"are increasingly exploiting unsupported edge devices that no longer receive vendor updates,\" and that some of these attackers have \"ties to nation-state adversaries\" [4][5]. Once a compromised edge device is under attacker control, it can be used to move laterally across agency networks, access identity management systems, and exfiltrate data.\n\n\"Unsupported devices pose a serious risk to federal systems and should never remain on enterprise networks,\" CISA Acting Director Madhu Gottumukkala stated [3].\n\n### The Timeline\n\nBOD 26-02 lays out a phased approach spanning two years [1][2]:\n\n- **Immediately**: Agencies must update all vendor-supported edge devices still running end-of-support software to current, supported versions.\n- **Within 3 months**: Complete an inventory of all devices on CISA's curated End-of-Service (EOS) Edge Device List and report findings to the agency.\n- **Within 12 months**: Decommission all devices that have already passed their end-of-support date, and inventory any devices approaching end-of-support within the next year.\n- **Within 18 months**: Fully remove all remaining end-of-support edge devices from agency networks.\n- **Within 24 months**: Establish continuous discovery processes to identify devices approaching end-of-support on an ongoing basis.\n\nCISA has compiled a curated EOS Edge Device List tailored to hardware \"predominant in the federal government,\" according to Andersen, though the list is not publicly available [4]. Agencies are also directed to verify support status directly with vendors.\n\n## Why It Matters\n\nEdge devices hold privileged network positions with extensive integrations into identity management systems, making them high-value targets for state-sponsored intrusion campaigns [1]. Unlike endpoint devices such as laptops or workstations — which typically receive more monitoring attention — aging network infrastructure often operates in the background, running firmware that was last updated years ago.\n\nThe directive's own language underscores the urgency: \"The imminent threat of exploitation to agency information systems running EOS edge devices is substantial and constant\" [1][2]. CISA has observed that advanced threat actors are not merely scanning for these devices but actively conducting \"widespread exploitation campaigns\" against them [5].\n\nThe phased timeline acknowledges the operational reality that replacing network infrastructure is expensive and disruptive, particularly for agencies running legacy or mission-critical operational technology. Andersen emphasized that CISA plans to work \"collaboratively with agencies,\" especially where replacing equipment could disrupt operations [3][4].\n\n## What We Don't Know\n\nCISA declined to link the directive to any specific intrusion campaign. Andersen acknowledged nation-state involvement but stopped short of naming specific threat groups or incidents [5]. The scale of the problem — how many devices across the federal civilian estate are currently unsupported — has not been disclosed, though the multi-year timeline and coordination with OMB suggest the remediation effort is substantial.\n\nIt also remains unclear how effectively CISA can enforce compliance. While binding operational directives carry legal weight for Federal Civilian Executive Branch agencies, enforcement relies on OMB compliance tracking rather than direct penalties [3]. Past directives have met with uneven implementation across the government.\n\nThe curated EOS Edge Device List itself is not publicly available, making it difficult for outside observers — or the private sector — to assess which specific hardware models are considered most at risk [4].\n\n## Broader Context\n\nBOD 26-02 follows a pattern of increasingly assertive CISA action on network perimeter security. In February 2025, CISA and international partners released joint guidance on securing edge devices, and the agency has previously mandated that agencies patch internet-exposed systems on tight timelines [5]. The new directive extends that logic from software patching to hardware lifecycle management — a harder, more expensive problem that requires physical replacement rather than a downloaded update.\n\nWhile the directive applies only to federal civilian agencies, CISA is encouraging all network defenders to follow similar practices [2]. Given that nation-state actors routinely target the same classes of edge devices in both government and corporate networks, the underlying threat applies broadly across sectors.\n\n---\n\n**Sources:**\n\n[1] CISA, \"BOD 26-02: Mitigating Risk From End-of-Support Edge Devices,\" February 5, 2026.\n\n[2] BleepingComputer, \"CISA orders federal agencies to replace end-of-life edge devices,\" February 2026.\n\n[3] CyberScoop, \"CISA tells agencies to stop using unsupported edge devices,\" February 2026.\n\n[4] Federal News Network, \"CISA tells agencies to identify, upgrade unsupported edge devices,\" February 2026.\n\n[5] Nextgov/FCW, \"CISA orders agencies to patch and replace end-of-life devices, citing active exploitation,\" February 2026."
