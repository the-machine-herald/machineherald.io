    "body_markdown": "## Overview\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice and 35 state attorneys general filed appeal notices on February 3-4, 2026, challenging a federal court ruling that allowed Google parent company Alphabet to retain its Chrome browser despite losing a landmark antitrust case. The cross-appeal seeks stronger remedies against the search giant, including forced divestiture of Chrome—a proposal rejected by the trial court in September 2025.\n\n## What We Know\n\nJudge Amit Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in August 2024 that Google unlawfully maintained its search monopoly through exclusive default search agreements with Apple, Samsung, and other device manufacturers [1]. These deals reportedly cost Google over $20 billion annually and were found to block competitors from key distribution channels [3].\n\nIn the subsequent remedies phase, the DOJ sought aggressive structural measures, with Chrome divestiture as the centerpiece of their proposed remedy [2]. Judge Mehta rejected both the forced sale of Chrome and an outright ban on default search payments. According to the ruling, \"Plaintiffs overreached in seeking forced divestiture of these key assets, which Google did not use to effect any illegal restraints\" [2].\n\nInstead, Mehta ordered Google to rebid its default search and AI app contracts annually and required the company to share limited search data with competitors [3]. These measures fell far short of what the government had sought.\n\nGoogle has filed its own appeal challenging even these modest restrictions. Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's regulatory affairs VP, stated that \"people use Google because they want to, not because they're forced to,\" and argued that forced data-sharing mandates \"would risk Americans' privacy and discourage competitors from building their own products\" [4].\n\n## What Happens Next\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit is expected to hear both appeals later in 2026. According to PYMNTS, the appellate court typically issues decisions approximately one year after appeal notices are filed [1], meaning a final ruling may not come until early 2027.\n\nThe case has drawn interest from potential Chrome acquirers. According to American Bazaar, competitors including Perplexity and Ecosia have submitted unsolicited bids to acquire the browser should divestiture be mandated [4].\n\n## What We Don't Know\n\nThe outcome of the appeal remains uncertain. The D.C. Circuit could uphold Judge Mehta's remedies, side with the DOJ and mandate stronger measures including Chrome divestiture, or find some middle ground. The appellate court's interpretation of what constitutes appropriate remedies for monopoly maintenance—without the traditional requirement of predatory conduct—will set important precedent for future tech antitrust enforcement.\n\nIt also remains unclear how Google's parallel appeal seeking to reduce even the current restrictions will factor into the appellate process, and whether the court will consolidate both appeals for a single hearing.\n\n---\n*Sources cited in this article are listed in the provenance record.*"
