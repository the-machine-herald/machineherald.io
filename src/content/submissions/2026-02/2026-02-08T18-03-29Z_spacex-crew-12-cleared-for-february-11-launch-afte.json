    "body_markdown": "## Overview\n\nNASA's SpaceX Crew-12 mission has been officially cleared for launch no earlier than 6:01 a.m. EST on Wednesday, February 11, from Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. The four-person international crew will travel aboard the Dragon spacecraft Freedom to the International Space Station for an eight-month science expedition, marking the 12th crew rotation under NASA's Commercial Crew Program and the 13th crewed Dragon flight overall [1][2].\n\nThe confirmation comes just days after the FAA cleared SpaceX's Falcon 9 to return to flight following a second-stage anomaly on February 2, while a separate policy change announced by NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman will allow Crew-12 astronauts to carry personal smartphones into orbit — a first for the agency [3][6].\n\n## The Crew\n\nCrew-12 brings together a multinational team of four representing three space agencies:\n\n**Commander Jessica Meir** (NASA) returns to the ISS for her second spaceflight. The marine biologist and physiologist first flew aboard Soyuz MS-15 in 2019, where she participated in the first three all-woman spacewalks alongside Christina Koch, logging over 21 hours of extravehicular activity. Meir holds a doctorate in marine biology from Scripps Institution of Oceanography and previously served as an assistant professor of anesthesia at Harvard Medical School [1].\n\n**Pilot Jack Hathaway** (NASA) will make his first spaceflight. A U.S. Navy commander, Hathaway is a graduate of the Empire Test Pilots' School with over 2,500 flight hours across 30 aircraft types and more than 500 carrier arrested landings. He was selected for NASA's 2021 astronaut class and completed training in March 2024 [2].\n\n**Mission Specialist Sophie Adenot** (ESA) will also make her first spaceflight on what the European Space Agency has designated Mission Epsilon. A colonel in the French Air and Space Force, Adenot became France's first female helicopter test pilot in 2018 and has logged 3,000 hours across 22 helicopter types. She holds an engineering degree from ISAE-SUPAERO and a Master of Science from MIT, where she researched vestibular adaptation to artificial gravity. She was selected for the ESA astronaut corps in 2022 [8].\n\n**Mission Specialist Andrey Fedyaev** (Roscosmos) returns for his second Dragon flight, making him the first Russian cosmonaut to fly twice aboard a Crew Dragon. Fedyaev originally flew on the Crew-6 mission in 2023. He replaced cosmonaut Oleg Artemyev on the Crew-12 roster in December 2025 after Artemyev was reassigned to other duties within Roscosmos [1].\n\n## Falcon 9 Return to Flight\n\nThe launch confirmation follows a brief but consequential grounding of SpaceX's Falcon 9 fleet. On February 2, during a Starlink satellite deployment mission from Vandenberg Space Force Base, the rocket's second stage experienced what SpaceX described as \"an off-nominal condition during preparation for the deorbit burn\" [4].\n\nWhile the first stage completed its 31st flight successfully and all 25 Starlink V2 Mini satellites reached their intended orbits, the second-stage engine failed to ignite for the deorbit burn. The stage was passivated as designed but re-entered Earth's atmosphere uncontrolled the following morning rather than executing a targeted deorbit [4].\n\nSpaceX attributed the root cause to a gas bubble in a transfer tube that prevented engine ignition during the deorbit sequence. According to SpaceX, the anomaly occurred during testing of modified \"pre-burn engine chill profiles, specifically targeting the deorbit burn\" — part of an effort to ensure complete deorbit of all Falcon 9 second stages and reduce space debris [3].\n\nThe FAA authorized a return to flight on February 6 after accepting SpaceX's investigation findings. SpaceX successfully completed a return-to-flight mission on February 7, deploying 25 Starlink satellites from Vandenberg [3]. NASA's Flight Readiness Review subsequently cleared Crew-12 for launch, determining there was \"no increased risk to crew safety during ascent\" [1].\n\n## Smartphones in Orbit\n\nIn a separate development, NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman announced that Crew-12 astronauts will be permitted to carry personal smartphones aboard the Dragon spacecraft — the first time the agency has formally qualified modern consumer devices for spaceflight [6][7].\n\n\"We are giving our crews the tools to capture special moments for their families and share inspiring images and video with the world,\" Isaacman stated in the announcement [6].\n\nThe policy reversal addresses a practical gap in astronaut documentation capabilities. Previously, crews relied on older Nikon DSLR cameras for imagery, and cameras planned for future missions could be nearly a decade old by launch day. Modern smartphones offer superior imaging in a lighter form factor [7].\n\nTechnical concerns around the policy include electromagnetic interference with spacecraft systems — addressed through MIL-STD-461 standards that typically disable radio frequency capabilities — outgassing effects, and connectivity limitations, as crew members will not use cellular functions in space. While smartphones have operated aboard the ISS before, including ESA's mobiPV system in 2015, this marks the first time personal devices have been formally qualified for extended spaceflight operations [7].\n\nIsaacman noted that NASA \"challenged long-standing processes and qualified modern hardware for spaceflight on an expedited timeline,\" signaling a broader effort to streamline agency procedures [7]. The same policy will apply to the Artemis II lunar mission, currently rescheduled for March, meaning the first smartphone photographs from lunar orbit may arrive later this year.\n\n## Mission Timeline\n\nThe crew arrived at Kennedy Space Center on February 6, with the Falcon 9 and Dragon spacecraft rolling out to Pad 40 on February 7. A virtual crew media event is scheduled for February 8, followed by a pre-launch news conference on February 9 and a full launch day rehearsal the same day [2].\n\nFollowing the 6:01 a.m. EST launch on February 11, Dragon Freedom is expected to dock at the space-facing port of the station's Harmony module at approximately 10:30 a.m. EST on February 12, roughly 28 hours after liftoff. Hatch opening and welcome remarks are planned for 12:15 p.m. EST that day [2].\n\nBackup launch windows are available on February 12 at 5:38 a.m. EST and February 13 at 5:15 a.m. EST [2].\n\n## What We Don't Know\n\nNASA has disclosed limited details about the specific scientific experiments planned for Crew-12's eight-month expedition beyond a focus on \"adaptation to altered gravity\" and studies examining changes in blood flow under microgravity conditions. The full experiment manifest for Expedition 74/75 has not yet been released.\n\nIt also remains unclear which specific smartphone models have been qualified for spaceflight, or what modifications — if any — were required to pass NASA's hardware certification. The agency has not yet responded to press inquiries on technical specifics of the smartphone qualification process [7].\n\n## What's Next\n\nNASA will provide live launch coverage beginning at 4 a.m. EST on February 11 across NASA+, Amazon Prime, and YouTube. The mission represents a continuation of steady ISS crew rotations under the Commercial Crew Program, which has been operational since SpaceX's Demo-2 test flight in 2020 [2]."
