Circuit, after a district judge ruled in November 2025 that the social media giant does not hold a monopoly in personal social networking.\n\nThe decision to appeal signals the FTC's continued commitment to holding large technology companies accountable for acquisitions made over a decade ago, even as the competitive landscape has shifted dramatically beneath the agency's legal theories.\n\n## The Case That Tested Antitrust in a Moving Market\n\nThe FTC's lawsuit, filed in December 2020 alongside 46 state attorneys general, accused Meta of operating an illegal \"buy-or-bury\" scheme: acquiring rising competitors Instagram in 2012 for $1 billion and WhatsApp in 2014 for $19 billion before they could mature into serious threats to Facebook's dominance.\n\nThe agency's theory rested on a carefully defined market — \"personal social networking services\" — comprising platforms where users primarily interact with friends and family. Under that definition, the relevant competitors were limited to Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and the far smaller MeWe.\n\nMeta rejected that framing throughout the litigation, arguing that it competes daily against TikTok, YouTube, and a widening universe of entertainment-driven platforms. That broader view ultimately prevailed when U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, after a full bench trial with CEO Mark Zuckerberg on the stand, sided with the company in a ruling issued [on November 18, 2025, according to NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/18/nx-s1-5495626/meta-ftc-instagram-whatsapp-antitrust-ruling).\n\n## Why the Judge Ruled for Meta\n\nJudge Boasberg's opinion turned on a decisive factual finding: when users cannot access Facebook or Instagram, they turn first to TikTok and YouTube — and vice versa. That substitutability, the court held, places those platforms inside the relevant market, where Meta's share is far from monopolistic.\n\nThe ruling also grappled with a thorny temporal problem. The FTC's monopolization claim required proof of *current* market power, not conduct from 2012 or 2014. By the time of the 2025 trial, TikTok — not even mentioned in earlier rulings from 2021 and 2022 — had become, in Boasberg's words, \"Meta's fiercest rival.\" The judge also found that only 17 percent of time spent on Facebook involved friends' posts, further undermining the agency's narrow market definition.\n\nOn advertising, the FTC argued that a monopolist's ability to load feeds with more ads harmed users, but the court found no compelling evidence that ad volume or quality degraded the user experience in a way that demonstrated monopoly power.\n\n## The Appeal and Its Legal Stakes\n\nIn filing its notice of appeal, [the FTC stated](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2026/01/ftc-appeals-ruling-meta-monopolization-case) that \"Meta violated our antitrust laws when it acquired Instagram and WhatsApp\" and that American consumers have suffered from the resulting concentration. FTC Bureau of Competition director Daniel Guarnera said the agency would \"continue fighting its historic case against Meta to ensure that competition can thrive.\"\n\n[CNBC reported](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/20/ftc-appeals-metaruling-antitrust-instagram-whatsapp.html) that the appeal initiates a process that could eventually reach the Supreme Court, though the timeline is long. Opening briefs from the FTC are expected to take several months, with Meta's response following thereafter. Oral arguments before a three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit are tentatively expected by late summer or autumn of 2026.\n\nThe central question for the appeals court is whether Boasberg applied the right legal standard. Critics of the ruling argue that monopoly power should have been evaluated at the time of the acquisitions, when Instagram and WhatsApp were still independent, potentially disruptive forces — not in 2025, when they had been absorbed for over a decade and the market had reorganized around Meta's dominance. Applying an acquisition-date baseline could, in theory, produce a different result on appeal.\n\nMeta, for its part, called the district court's decision \"correct\" and said it reflects the \"fierce competition\" the company encounters daily. [Euronews noted](https://www.euronews.com/business/2026/01/21/ftc-presses-on-with-appeal-after-metas-monopoly-battle-win) that Meta framed the ruling as validating its position that broad consumer choice in social media precludes a finding of monopoly power.\n\n## What the Case Reveals About Big Tech Antitrust Enforcement\n\nThe FTC v. Meta saga illustrates the structural challenge facing regulators who attempt to unwind long-completed acquisitions in fast-moving technology markets. The legal doctrines designed to police corporate concentration were largely built for industries where markets evolve slowly. Social media upended those assumptions.\n\nWhen the FTC sued in 2020, TikTok had not yet cycled through the bans, near-bans, and political reversals that defined its trajectory in the United States. By trial in 2025, it had transformed the evidentiary record. Regulators face an inherent timing trap: moves to block acquisitions must often be made quickly, with incomplete information, while litigation challenging those deals drags on long enough for the competitive facts to change beneath them.\n\nThe case also illustrates the difficulty of market definition in digital ecosystems. The FTC staked its theory on a distinctive \"social graph\" — the unique web of personal connections hosted on Facebook and Instagram that no competitor has fully replicated. Legal scholars supportive of the agency's position argue that this social graph represents a genuine structural barrier to entry that TikTok's entertainment-focused model does not overcome. But the district court was unmoved, finding that consumer behavior in practice reflects substitutability across platforms.\n\nThe appeal keeps regulatory uncertainty alive for Meta investors and enterprise partners through at least 2027. But its deeper significance lies in the precedent it may set for how courts evaluate acquisitions made during an era of minimal antitrust scrutiny — acquisitions that critics argue were permissible under a laissez-faire regulatory consensus that has since collapsed.\n\n[The Hill reported](https://www.thehill.com/policy/technology/5697579-ftc-appeal-meta-monopoly/) that the case continues alongside other unresolved antitrust actions in the tech sector, including the remedies phase of the DOJ's victory against Google in its search monopoly case and ongoing scrutiny of Apple's App Store practices — suggesting that 2026 could become a defining year for the shape of digital competition law in the United States.\n\n## The Broader Regulatory Context\n\nThe FTC's persistence with the Meta appeal coincides with a broader moment of reckoning for platform power. The European Union has already imposed fines on both Apple and Meta for violations of the Digital Markets Act, with behavioral remedies that U.S. courts have not imposed domestically. The contrast has renewed debate about whether American antitrust law — with its high evidentiary burdens and consumer-welfare framing — is structurally equipped to address the dynamics of digital markets built on network effects, data accumulation, and the strategic acquisition of nascent competitors before they can grow into genuine threats.\n\nWhether the D.C. Circuit ultimately agrees with the FTC's theory of the case may determine not just Meta's corporate structure, but the future of federal merger enforcement in technology more broadly."
