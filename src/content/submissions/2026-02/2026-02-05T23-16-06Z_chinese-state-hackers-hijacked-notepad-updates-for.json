    "body_markdown": "## Overview\n\nNotepad++, one of the most widely used open-source text editors for Windows, disclosed on February 2, 2026, that its software update infrastructure had been compromised by a suspected Chinese state-sponsored hacking group for approximately six months. The attack, attributed to the advanced persistent threat (APT) group known as Lotus Blossom (also tracked as Billbug), selectively delivered malicious payloads to a small number of targeted organizations with interests in East Asia, including government agencies, telecom companies, and critical infrastructure operators.\n\nThe campaign represents a sophisticated supply chain attack that exploited a vulnerability in the shared hosting server where Notepad++'s website was hosted, rather than compromising the application's source code itself.\n\n## What We Know\n\n### Timeline and Scope\n\nAccording to analysis published by Kaspersky [1], the overall compromise period spanned from June through December 2, 2025, when all attacker access was definitively terminated. Active malicious update deployments occurred across four distinct phases from July through October 2025, with the attackers constantly rotating command-and-control (C2) server addresses, downloaders, and final payloads.\n\nThe attack was selectively targeted rather than broadly deployed. According to The Record [2], Notepad++ developers emphasized it was not a mass attack affecting all users. Kaspersky researchers identified approximately a dozen compromised machines across individuals in Vietnam, El Salvador, and Australia, as well as a Philippine government organization, an El Salvadorian financial institution, and a Vietnamese IT service provider [1].\n\nOpen Source For You [3] reported that the broader set of targets included government agencies, telecom companies, the aviation sector, critical infrastructure operators, and media organizations — consistent with Lotus Blossom's known pattern of focused intelligence gathering.\n\n### Attack Mechanism\n\nThe attackers compromised the infrastructure at the hosting provider level, intercepting and redirecting update traffic destined for notepad-plus-plus.org [2]. This \"on-path\" approach intercepted network traffic after it left users' computers but before reaching legitimate servers, making detection particularly difficult and leaving minimal forensic evidence.\n\nThe legitimate Notepad++ updater process (GUP.exe) was subverted to distribute malicious `update.exe` files through the official update infrastructure [1].\n\n### Three Distinct Infection Chains\n\nKaspersky researchers documented three separate infection chains used during the campaign [1]:\n\n**Chain 1 (Late July - Early August 2025):** Distributed an NSIS installer (~1 MB) that exploited a legacy ProShow software vulnerability from the early 2010s to deliver a Metasploit downloader, which in turn deployed a Cobalt Strike Beacon for remote access.\n\n**Chain 2 (Mid-September - October 2025):** Used a lighter NSIS installer (~140 KB) with a DLL sideloading technique that abused a Lua interpreter. This chain showed the attackers transitioning their C2 infrastructure to new domains including `self-dns.it.com` and `safe-dns.it.com`.\n\n**Chain 3 (Early October 2025):** Deployed the custom Chrysalis backdoor — a known tool in Chinese-speaking threat actor toolkits — via DLL sideloading through BluetoothService.exe. This chain did not use Cobalt Strike, indicating a shift in operational tactics.\n\nAcross all chains, the attackers conducted standard reconnaissance using commands like `whoami && tasklist` and `systeminfo && netstat -ano`, exfiltrating system information to the temp.sh hosting service [1].\n\n### Attribution\n\nRapid7 attributed the campaign to Lotus Blossom, a long-running China-aligned espionage group [3]. The attribution was strengthened by the use of the Chrysalis backdoor and DLL sideloading patterns previously documented in Lotus Blossom operations [1]. Multiple independent security researchers reached the same conclusion regarding Chinese state sponsorship [2].\n\nThe selective targeting parallels the 2018 ASUS ShadowHammer campaign, where malicious updates reached hundreds of thousands of systems but targeted only a few hundred specific victims [2].\n\n### Response and Remediation\n\nNotepad++ developer Don Ho documented that the hosting provider confirmed the compromise, and the vulnerability was patched in November 2025 [3]. When the attackers attempted to re-exploit the fixed vulnerability, the attempt failed.\n\nThe Notepad++ team migrated its update infrastructure to a new hosting provider and introduced additional security controls. The WinGup updater was enhanced in version 8.8.9 to verify both the certificate and signature of downloaded installers, and the XML returned by the update server is now signed using XMLDSig [2]. Version 8.9.1 introduced further hardening, and users were urged to upgrade as a precaution.\n\n## What We Don't Know\n\nSeveral aspects of the attack remain unclear:\n\n- **Exact exploitation method:** While the compromise occurred at the hosting provider level through a bug on the shared hosting server, the precise technical vulnerability has not been publicly disclosed.\n- **Full victim count:** Only approximately a dozen confirmed compromised machines have been identified by Kaspersky, but the actual number of targeted or affected organizations could be larger.\n- **Data exfiltrated:** The specific intelligence gathered from compromised targets has not been disclosed.\n- **Hosting provider identity:** The shared hosting provider whose infrastructure was exploited has not been publicly named.\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe Notepad++ compromise highlights a growing trend in supply chain attacks targeting open-source software infrastructure. Unlike attacks that inject malicious code into source repositories, this campaign targeted the delivery mechanism — a subtler approach that leaves the software's codebase clean while compromising its distribution channel.\n\nThe attack's selective targeting is particularly noteworthy. Rather than casting a wide net, Lotus Blossom used the compromised update infrastructure as a precision tool, redirecting only specific users to malicious payloads. This approach reduced the risk of detection while maximizing intelligence value from high-priority targets.\n\nFor the open-source ecosystem, the incident underscores a critical vulnerability: many widely used projects rely on shared hosting infrastructure that may not have the same security posture as the software they distribute. The Notepad++ team's post-incident measures — cryptographic verification of updates and infrastructure migration — represent best practices that other open-source projects should consider adopting proactively.\n\nThe six-month dwell time before public disclosure also raises questions about detection capabilities. With Kaspersky identifying the compromise through behavioral analysis and IoC matching, the incident demonstrates the importance of endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions and threat intelligence sharing in identifying supply chain attacks that bypass traditional security controls.\n\n---\n\n*Sources cited in this article are listed in the provenance record.*"
