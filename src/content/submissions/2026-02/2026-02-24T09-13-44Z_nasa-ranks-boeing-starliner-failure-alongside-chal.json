The report found that hardware failures were compounded by leadership failures and a silenced workforce culture, with NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman saying the most troubling aspect of the incident was not the mechanical problems but \"decision making and leadership.\"\n\n## What Happened\n\nBoeing's CST-100 Starliner launched on 5 June 2024 with NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams aboard for what was planned as an 8-to-14-day test flight to the International Space Station. Shortly after launch, mission managers detected helium leaks in the capsule's propulsion system, and multiple thrusters failed during approach to the station. [According to NASA's report](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-releases-report-on-starliner-crewed-flight-test-investigation/), the anomalies \"cascaded into multiple thruster failures and a temporary loss of six-degree-of-freedom control\" — meaning the spacecraft briefly lost the ability to maneuver in any direction.\n\nWeeks of on-orbit testing followed, but NASA ultimately determined it could not confidently certify Starliner's safety for the return trip. In September 2024 the capsule was sent back to Earth uncrewed. Wilmore and Williams remained on the ISS for more than nine months, returning to Earth aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon, [as reported by NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/19/nx-s1-5719870/nasa-starliner-boeing-mishap-isaacman).\n\nThe uncrewed return itself revealed a further concern: investigators found the spacecraft had \"no available backup options had another failure occurred\" during that descent.\n\n## Three Root Causes\n\nThe investigation identified three interconnected root causes, [according to Spaceflight Now](https://spaceflightnow.com/2026/02/19/independent-report-sharply-criticizes-nasa-management-boeing-for-troubled-starliner-flight/):\n\n1. **Hardware and qualification failures**: Boeing's propulsion system design \"allowed hardware to operate outside qualification limits,\" and NASA's oversight was \"too hands off,\" leaving the agency without the systems knowledge needed to independently certify the spacecraft.\n\n2. **Leadership missteps**: The desire to sustain two commercial crew transportation providers — SpaceX and Boeing — drove decision-making in ways that \"exceeded reasonable bounds and placed the mission, the crew, and America's space program at risk.\"\n\n3. **Cultural breakdowns**: Over 30 launch attempts created what the report called \"schedule pressure and decision fatigue.\" Workers reported a toxic dynamic: \"There was yelling in meetings. It was emotionally charged and unproductive.\" One employee said, \"If you weren't aligned with the desired outcome, your input was filtered out or dismissed,\" while another stated, \"I stopped speaking up because I knew I would be dismissed.\"\n\n## What It Means for Boeing\n\n[Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-19/nasa-puts-starliner-mishap-in-same-class-as-shuttle-tragedies) noted that the Type A designation — which applies to incidents involving potential loss of life, loss of vehicle, or more than $2 million in damage — is the same classification used for the Challenger explosion in 1986, the Columbia disintegration in 2003, and the Apollo 1 fire in 1967. No crew members were lost in the Starliner incident, but the classification reflects the potential severity.\n\nIsaacman acknowledged both organizations share responsibility: \"Starliner has design and engineering deficiencies that must be corrected,\" while also stating, \"We are taking ownership of our shortcomings.\" The report issued 61 recommendations spanning technical, organizational, and cultural domains.\n\n## What Comes Next\n\nDespite the severity of the classification, NASA stated its intention to continue flying Starliner and maintain two commercial crew providers alongside SpaceX. No specific personnel actions were named in the public release, though Isaacman promised \"leadership accountability.\"\n\nThe report's emphasis on cultural and leadership failures — rather than purely technical remediation — raises questions about whether the recommended fixes can be verified before another crewed flight. The investigation found that improving \"technical excellence, transparent communication, and clear roles and responsibilities\" are prerequisites for any future Starliner missions.\n\n## What We Don't Know\n\nThe report does not fully detail which individuals will face accountability or on what timeline. The precise schedule for Starliner's return to flight has not been announced, nor has Boeing indicated publicly how it plans to address the qualification gaps in its propulsion design."
