    "body_markdown": "## Overview\n\nOpenAI released GPT-5.3-Codex on February 5, 2026, calling it the most capable agentic coding model the company has produced. The model unifies the coding performance of GPT-5.2-Codex with the broader reasoning and professional knowledge capabilities of GPT-5.2 into a single system that is also 25 percent faster [1]. In a first for the company, OpenAI has classified the model as \"High\" capability for cybersecurity under its Preparedness Framework, triggering additional safeguards and a delay to full API access [2][3].\n\n## What We Know\n\n### Performance and Benchmarks\n\nGPT-5.3-Codex shows modest gains over its predecessor on traditional coding benchmarks but delivers sharp improvements on agentic and system-interaction tasks [4][5][7]:\n\n| Benchmark | GPT-5.3-Codex | GPT-5.2-Codex | Change |\n|-----------|---------------|---------------|--------|\n| SWE-Bench Pro | 56.8% | 56.4% | +0.4 pp |\n| Terminal-Bench 2.0 | 77.3% | 64.0% | +13.3 pp |\n| OSWorld-Verified | 64.7% | 38.2% | +26.5 pp |\n| Cybersecurity CTF | 77.6% | 67.4% | +10.2 pp |\n\nAccording to OpenAI, the model achieves these scores while consuming fewer output tokens than any prior model, which could reduce per-patch costs in production workflows [1][7].\n\nThe model features a 400,000-token context window with what OpenAI calls a \"Perfect Recall\" attention mechanism, along with a 128,000-token output limit that enables complete multi-file projects in single responses [6].\n\n### Agentic Capabilities\n\nThe most significant improvements appear in agentic workflows. The 26.5 percentage-point jump on OSWorld-Verified, which measures a model's ability to operate within desktop environments, approaches what OpenAI describes as the roughly 72 percent human baseline for those tasks [6]. Terminal-Bench 2.0 scores similarly reflect the model's improved ability to chain terminal commands and manage system-level operations.\n\nOpenAI highlights that GPT-5.3-Codex can be steered mid-task without losing context, allowing developers to redirect ongoing work without restarting from scratch [1][4]. The model also produces \"deep diffs\" that explain the rationale behind code patches, and the company says it has reduced linting loops and premature test completion compared to its predecessor [7].\n\n### Self-Bootstrapping\n\nIn a notable claim, OpenAI states that GPT-5.3-Codex is \"the first model that was instrumental in creating itself.\" According to the company, the Codex team used early versions of the model to debug its own training pipeline, manage deployment tasks, and diagnose test results and evaluations [1].\n\n### Infrastructure and Training\n\nThe model was trained and is served on NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 systems, achieving what OpenAI describes as four times faster training performance than previous generations with three-day iteration cycles [4][6]. It supports native agentic operations including tool use, API calls, file navigation, and self-testing.\n\n### Availability and Pricing\n\nGPT-5.3-Codex is available now through paid ChatGPT plans across the Codex app, CLI, IDE extensions, and web interface. Rate limits have been doubled for paid users [5][6]. OpenAI has also released a new Codex app for macOS, described as a \"command center for agentic workflows\" [6].\n\nAPI access has not yet been enabled. OpenAI says it will follow \"once it's safely enabled,\" but has not set a date [1][7]. API pricing has not been disclosed. The predecessor, GPT-5.2-Codex, was priced at $1.75 per million input tokens and $14.00 per million output tokens [5].\n\n## Cybersecurity: A New Threshold\n\nThe most consequential aspect of this release may not be the performance gains but the security classification. GPT-5.3-Codex is the first model OpenAI has treated as \"High\" capability for cybersecurity under its Preparedness Framework [2][3].\n\nUnder that framework, \"High\" cybersecurity capability is defined as a model that removes existing bottlenecks to scaling cyber operations, including by automating end-to-end cyber operations against reasonably hardened targets or by automating the discovery and exploitation of operationally relevant vulnerabilities [2][3].\n\nOpenAI has said it does not have definitive evidence that the model reaches the High threshold, but is taking a precautionary approach because it \"cannot rule out the possibility\" that GPT-5.3-Codex may be capable enough [2]. According to Fortune, CEO Sam Altman described it as \"the first model that hits 'high' for cybersecurity on OpenAI's preparedness framework,\" acknowledging that the model could \"meaningfully enable real-world cyber harm, especially if automated or used at scale\" [3].\n\nThe classification has prompted several concrete measures. OpenAI is withholding full API access to prevent large-scale automation of the model's capabilities. The company has launched a \"Trusted Access for Cyber\" pilot program to gate sensitive applications behind additional controls, and announced $10 million in API credits for cyber defense initiatives along with an \"Aardvark\" security research agent pilot program [7].\n\n## What We Don't Know\n\n- **API timeline and pricing**: OpenAI has not committed to a date for full API availability, and pricing remains unannounced. This uncertainty complicates production migration planning for enterprise teams.\n- **Preparedness Framework specifics**: The system card indicates High classification, but OpenAI acknowledges it lacks definitive evidence the threshold has been reached. The precise evaluations and red-team findings underlying this assessment have not been fully detailed.\n- **Real-world performance at launch**: Early community reports suggest mixed experiences. One developer on the OpenAI Community forum reported speeds \"3x slower than 5.2 Codex,\" though this may reflect launch-day infrastructure strain rather than inherent model latency [4].\n- **Independent benchmarking**: The model launched the same day as Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.6, and independent comparative evaluations are still forthcoming.\n\n## Analysis\n\nGPT-5.3-Codex represents a clear shift in where OpenAI sees the frontier for coding models. The SWE-Bench Pro improvement is negligible at 0.4 percentage points, but the dramatic gains on Terminal-Bench and OSWorld signal that OpenAI is optimizing not for isolated code generation but for the kind of sustained, tool-using agentic workflows that increasingly define AI-assisted development.\n\nThe cybersecurity classification is arguably more significant than any benchmark result. By publicly designating GPT-5.3-Codex as \"High\" risk and deliberately restricting API access, OpenAI is establishing a precedent for how frontier AI labs handle models whose capabilities approach dangerous thresholds. Whether this reflects genuine caution or strategic positioning ahead of expected AI regulation remains an open question, but the practical effect is the same: developers will have to wait for full programmatic access to what may be the most capable coding model available.\n\nThe simultaneous release with Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.6 on the same day sets up a direct competitive comparison that will likely play out over the coming weeks as developers benchmark both models on real-world tasks."
