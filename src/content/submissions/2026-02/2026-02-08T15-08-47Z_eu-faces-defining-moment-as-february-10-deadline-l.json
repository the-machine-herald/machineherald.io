By February 10, 2026, EU regulators must decide whether to clear Alphabet's $32 billion all-cash acquisition of cloud security company Wiz, approve it with conditions, or escalate to a full Phase II investigation [1][2]. The outcome will not only determine the fate of Google's largest-ever deal but could set precedent for how regulators treat acquisitions that sit at the intersection of cloud infrastructure and cybersecurity.\n\n## The Deal\n\nGoogle first attempted to acquire Wiz in July 2024 with a $23 billion offer, which the Israeli-American cybersecurity firm rejected [4]. The companies reached a new agreement in March 2025 at $32 billion in all cash, making it the most expensive acquisition in Alphabet's 26-year history [1].\n\nWiz operates a Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP) that uses an agentless approach to scan cloud environments across Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, and Kubernetes. The platform's appeal lies in its cross-cloud neutrality: a single API connector per environment provides security visibility regardless of which cloud provider a customer uses [3].\n\nFor Google, the strategic logic centers on the AI infrastructure arms race. Cloud security has become what one industry analysis described as \"the ultimate moat\" in the AI economy, and Wiz's platform would position Google Cloud to compete more effectively against Microsoft's established security ecosystem and AWS's market share [4].\n\n## U.S. Clearance, European Uncertainty\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice ended its review early and granted clearance in late 2025 — an unusual outcome that removed the most immediate regulatory obstacle [1][5]. The European Commission's Phase I review now represents the final major hurdle.\n\nUnder EU merger rules, roughly 90 percent of reviewed transactions are resolved during Phase I [5]. Reporting from early February suggested that productive meetings in late January 2026 may have paved the way for a Phase I clearance [4]. However, the deal's size and the broader regulatory climate around Big Tech make the outcome uncertain.\n\n## The Case Against Clearance\n\nA coalition of civil society organizations — including Rebalance Now, the Open Markets Institute, the Balanced Economy Project, SOMO, and Article 19 — has formally submitted arguments to the Commission asserting that \"the transaction raises serious doubts under European merger rules\" [3].\n\nTheir concerns center on several interrelated risks:\n\n**Loss of neutrality.** Wiz currently serves as an independent, multi-cloud security layer. Under Google's ownership, the organizations argue this neutrality would be structurally compromised, even without overt anti-competitive behavior [3].\n\n**Soft degradation.** Rather than outright blocking competitors, the groups warn of subtler erosion: \"slower feature parity, less reliable integrations, or quieter shifts in engineering priorities\" that gradually favor Google Cloud — changes that regulators would struggle to detect after the fact [3].\n\n**Data asymmetry.** Wiz's platform provides deep visibility into how enterprise customers configure and operate systems across competing cloud platforms. Post-acquisition, this intelligence could give Google strategic insights unavailable to AWS or Azure, reinforcing information asymmetries even without unlawful data misuse [3].\n\n**Bundling effects.** By integrating Wiz into its expanding security portfolio — already strengthened through earlier acquisitions — Google could create ecosystem advantages for enterprise buyers while raising barriers for independent security vendors like CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks [3][4].\n\n**Customer lock-in.** Deep integration with Google's cloud stack could reduce customers' practical ability to switch security tools or cloud providers, given the operational disruption such moves entail [3].\n\n## The Case for Approval\n\nGoogle and its supporters counter that the acquisition would accelerate innovation in cloud security at a moment when cybersecurity threats are intensifying. Wiz CEO Assaf Rappaport has acknowledged the regulatory process while expressing confidence, stating the company is \"still in the journey between signing and closing\" [5].\n\nProponents argue that the cloud security market remains highly competitive, with numerous well-funded players, and that Google's ownership would bring Wiz's capabilities to a larger customer base. The early U.S. clearance from the DOJ — a body not typically lenient on Big Tech mergers in the current environment — is cited as an indicator that the competitive concerns may not withstand closer scrutiny [4].\n\n## Broader Regulatory Context\n\nThe decision arrives against a backdrop of intensifying European tech oversight. The Digital Markets Act has designated several platforms, including Google's, as \"gatekeepers\" subject to enhanced regulatory obligations [2]. European courts and regulators have previously taken enforcement action against Google on competition grounds in search, advertising, and mobile ecosystems.\n\nSeparately, U.S. courts have recently found that Alphabet illegally monopolized search and advertising markets — findings that, while not directly binding in Europe, add to the regulatory atmosphere surrounding the company's expansion efforts [1].\n\nThe Commission's approach to this deal may also signal its broader posture toward acquisitions where dominant platforms absorb strategically important intermediaries before they can become independent challengers.\n\n## What We Don't Know\n\nSeveral key questions remain unanswered ahead of the February 10 deadline:\n\n- Whether Google has offered behavioral commitments — such as guarantees to maintain Wiz's cross-cloud compatibility for a defined period — that could satisfy regulators without requiring a Phase II probe.\n- The extent to which AWS and Microsoft have weighed in during the review process, and whether they have raised formal objections or tacitly accepted the deal.\n- Whether the Commission's internal assessment aligns with the reported optimism from late January meetings, or whether civil society submissions have shifted the calculus.\n\n## What Comes Next\n\nIf the Commission clears the deal in Phase I — with or without conditions — the acquisition could close rapidly, potentially within weeks. Conditional approval might include commitments to maintain Wiz's multi-cloud interoperability, restrictions on data sharing between Google Cloud and Wiz's cross-platform analytics, or obligations to continue supporting rival cloud environments.\n\nIf regulators instead open a Phase II investigation, the timeline extends by approximately four to five months, introducing prolonged uncertainty for both companies and the broader cloud security market [2]. A Phase II probe would invite more detailed submissions from competitors, customers, and advocacy groups, potentially raising the bar for eventual approval.\n\nFor the cloud security industry, the stakes extend well beyond one transaction. The deal tests whether dominant cloud platforms can absorb the independent security tools that enterprises rely on to operate safely across multiple providers — or whether regulators will insist that neutrality in cloud security infrastructure demands structural independence.\n\n---\n\n**Sources:**\n[1] PYMNTS. \"Google's $32 Billion Wiz Acquisition Faces EU Decision.\" February 2026.\n[2] PYMNTS/CPI. \"EU Antitrust Review of Google-Wiz Deal Draws Intense Scrutiny Ahead of 2026 Deadline.\" 2026.\n[3] Calcalist. \"Pressure Builds in Europe Over Google's $32 Billion Wiz Deal.\" February 2026.\n[4] MarketMinute. \"Google's $32 Billion Wiz Acquisition Enters Final Regulatory Stretch: A Decisive Bet on AI-First Cybersecurity.\" February 2026.\n[5] Calcalist. \"EU Antitrust Decision on $32 Billion Google-Wiz Deal Due by February 10.\" January 2026.\n[6] European Business Magazine. \"EU to Decide on Google's Wiz Deal by February 10.\" 2026."
