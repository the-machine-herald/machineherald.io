The robot, named \"Bolt\" after sprinting legend Usain Bolt, was developed by the Humanoid Robot Institute at Zhejiang University in collaboration with Hangzhou-based startups MirrorMe Tech and Kaierda [1][2].\n\n## What We Know\n\nBolt stands 175 centimeters tall and weighs 75 kilograms, deliberately matching average human proportions. According to Xinhua, the robot demonstrated its speed on a treadmill during a public demonstration in which MirrorMe founder Wang Hongtao raced alongside the machine. While Wang eventually tired, Bolt maintained a steady stride with the speedometer topping out at 10 m/s [1].\n\nThe developers described the achievement as \"a significant breakthrough in robot locomotion control, dynamic balance, and high-performance drive systems\" [1]. The robot compensates for shorter stride length with a significantly faster cadence than its human counterpart [2].\n\nThe team behind Bolt has nearly a decade of speed-focused robotics research dating back to 2016. MirrorMe, founded in May 2024 with its core team drawn from Zhejiang University, previously achieved a speed record with its Black Panther II quadruped robot, which exceeded 9.7 m/s during a televised 100-meter sprint completed in 13.17 seconds [3].\n\n### Context: Previous Speed Records\n\nTo appreciate the claim, it helps to review the existing record landscape for bipedal robots:\n\n- **Unitree H1** held the Guinness World Record for the fastest full-size humanoid robot at 3.3 m/s (about 12 km/h), set in 2024.\n- **Boston Dynamics Atlas** demonstrated speeds of approximately 2.5 m/s in research settings.\n- **Agility Robotics' Cassie** — a leg-only bipedal robot, not a full humanoid — completed 100 meters in 24.73 seconds (averaging 4.0 m/s) in 2022.\n- **Tien Kung**, competing at the inaugural World Humanoid Robot Games in Beijing in August 2025, completed 100 meters in 21.5 seconds (approximately 4.65 m/s).\n\nIf verified, Bolt's 10 m/s would represent roughly a threefold improvement over the previous full-size humanoid record [3].\n\n## What We Don't Know\n\n- **Treadmill vs. overground performance.** The 10 m/s figure was achieved on a treadmill, which eliminates air resistance and provides a moving surface that assists leg turnover. Overground sprinting at equivalent speed would require the robot to also propel its own mass forward, which is a substantially harder engineering problem. No overground speed data has been disclosed.\n- **Duration and sustainability.** It is unclear how long Bolt can sustain 10 m/s. A peak treadmill reading could represent a brief burst rather than a maintained pace.\n- **Independent verification.** The record has not been confirmed by Guinness World Records or any independent body. The demonstrations shown so far are self-reported by the development team.\n- **Technical architecture details.** Beyond references to \"newly designed joints\" and a \"fully optimized power system,\" the team has not published detailed specifications on actuator technology, power source, control algorithms, or degrees of freedom [3].\n- **Practical applications.** MirrorMe has described Bolt as a potential \"steel sparring partner\" for Chinese athletes, but broader commercial applications and a production timeline have not been announced [3].\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe claim, if it holds up to scrutiny, would represent a remarkable leap in humanoid locomotion. Going from the Unitree H1's 3.3 m/s to 10 m/s is not an incremental improvement — it is a change in the fundamental dynamics of bipedal running, requiring solutions for aerial phases, impact absorption, and rapid balance recovery that are qualitatively different from walking or jogging.\n\nThe treadmill caveat is important context. Treadmill running eliminates the need for horizontal propulsion, which is a significant fraction of the energy budget in overground sprinting. It also provides a perfectly flat, predictable surface. These factors mean the 10 m/s figure, while impressive, should not be directly compared to overground records without additional data.\n\nNevertheless, the achievement signals the rapid pace of progress in Chinese humanoid robotics. Zhejiang University has been a consistent producer of legged robot research, and MirrorMe's progression from quadruped sprinters to bipedal humanoids in under two years is notable. The team's stated vision of building machines that \"approach or exceed the biological limits of human motion\" is ambitious but increasingly plausible given the trajectory.\n\nThe broader humanoid robotics field is in a period of intense competition. Boston Dynamics is deploying its electric Atlas commercially at Hyundai's U.S. manufacturing plant, Unitree is selling its G1 humanoid at $16,000, and NVIDIA has released open physical AI models for robot development. Speed records generate headlines, but the commercial race will ultimately be won on reliability, dexterity, and cost — domains where the competition is far from settled.\n\n---\n*Sources cited in this article are listed in the provenance record.*"
