    "body_markdown": "## Overview\n\nMicrosoft's gaming division is entering a new era. Phil Spencer, the executive most associated with Xbox's modern identity, announced his retirement effective February 23, 2026, after 38 years at Microsoft and 12 years leading its gaming operations. In the same announcement, Xbox president and COO Sarah Bond also revealed she was leaving the company. To fill the void, Microsoft reached not into gaming's ranks but into its AI division: Asha Sharma, former head of Microsoft's CoreAI product group, has been named the new Microsoft Gaming CEO.\n\n## What We Know\n\nSpencer confirmed the news in a staff message, stating: \"After 38 years at Microsoft, that moment has arrived for me. I've made the decision to retire and begin the next chapter of my life,\" as reported by [Gematsu](https://www.gematsu.com/2026/02/microsoft-gaming-ceo-phil-spencer-retires-xbox-president-sarah-bond-resigns). Spencer had informed Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella of his intentions in the fall, seeking to engineer a structured transition rather than an abrupt departure. He will remain in an advisory role through summer 2026 to support his successor.\n\nAccording to [Kotaku](https://kotaku.com/phil-spencer-xbox-leaving-retirement-microsoft-2000672059), Spencer is retiring after serving as the public face of Xbox since the original console's 2001 launch—though his tenure as Gaming CEO spans the past 12 years. He is credited with championing player-friendly initiatives including cross-platform multiplayer and the Game Pass subscription service, and with executing Microsoft's $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard.\n\nSarah Bond, who many industry observers had expected to eventually succeed Spencer, instead resigned from the company entirely. According to [Game Informer](https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/20/phil-spencer-is-retiring-xbox-president-sarah-bond-is-leaving-and-microsofts-coreai-head), she committed to serving as a special adviser to Sharma during the transition period.\n\nSharma's appointment stands out for a different reason: she is an AI product executive, not a games industry veteran. She joined Microsoft in 2024 from Meta, where she served as Vice President of Product, and prior to that was Chief Operating Officer at Instacart. Her most recent Microsoft role was leading the CoreAI product division. Matt Booty, formerly head of Xbox Game Studios, has been elevated to Executive Vice President and Chief Content Officer, providing continuity on the games side under Sharma's broader leadership.\n\n## Sharma's Strategic Priorities\n\nIn her initial communication to staff, Sharma outlined three priorities: delivering great games, recommitting to Xbox and core console gaming, and developing new business models. Her comments were notably direct about what the division will not become. As reported by [Game Informer](https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/20/phil-spencer-is-retiring-xbox-president-sarah-bond-is-leaving-and-microsofts-coreai-head), Sharma wrote: \"Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology.\"\n\nThe statement—a pre-emptive rejection of AI-generated game content—is a conspicuous reassurance coming from someone who led Microsoft's CoreAI division. It reflects the industry anxiety that has followed repeated AI announcements from major studios, and suggests Sharma is aware her background will be scrutinized by players and developers alike.\n\n## Context: A Difficult Generation for Xbox\n\nSpencer's departure comes at a complicated moment for the brand. As noted by [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/entertainment/video-games/xbox-shakeup-phil-spencer-retires-sarah-bond-resigns-11559895), Xbox has struggled since the Xbox One's disappointing launch, and Game Pass—once the centerpiece of the division's consumer pitch—now costs $30 per month, a price that may limit its reach with casual players across multiple platforms. Several of Xbox's historically exclusive franchises, including Halo, have appeared on competing platforms.\n\nDespite these challenges, Microsoft Gaming enters this transition with scale: more than 500 million monthly active users and nearly 40 studios housing major franchises including The Elder Scrolls, Halo, and Call of Duty. Industry analysts cited by [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/entertainment/video-games/xbox-shakeup-phil-spencer-retires-sarah-bond-resigns-11559895) expect Microsoft to either launch a new console around 2028 or push further into cloud streaming technology.\n\n## What We Don't Know\n\nMicrosoft has not announced any changes to Xbox hardware plans or revealed specifics around next-generation console development. Sharma's full vision for restructuring the business—including what \"new business models\" concretely means—has not been detailed beyond her introductory remarks. Whether Bond's resignation reflects a strategic disagreement with the incoming leadership or is simply a personal decision is not publicly known. Spencer's plans post-Microsoft have not been disclosed."
