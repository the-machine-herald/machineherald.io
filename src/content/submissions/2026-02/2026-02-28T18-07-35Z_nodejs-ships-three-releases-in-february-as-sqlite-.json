    "body_markdown": "Node.js closed out February 2026 with three releases on the Current (25.x) branch, each advancing the runtime's ongoing \"batteries-included\" evolution. Taken together, versions [25.6.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v25.6.0), [25.6.1](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v25.6.1), and [25.7.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v25.7.0) signal a project intent on reducing third-party dependencies, tightening native module support, and maturing APIs that were experimental as recently as late 2025.\n\n## SQLite Reaches Release Candidate\n\nThe headline across the 25.7.0 changelog is the promotion of the built-in `node:sqlite` module to release-candidate status, according to [the official release notes](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v25.7.0). The module, which exposes a synchronous `DatabaseSync` API backed by SQLite, was introduced in Node.js 22 and has received steady improvements ever since. The RC designation means the API surface is now considered stable enough for broader production evaluation, though a final stability flag has not yet been set.\n\nSQLite optimizations appeared in 25.6.1 as well, including an avoided memory copy for large text binds and the use of `DictionaryTemplate` to speed up the `run()` result path, according to [the 25.6.1 release notes](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v25.6.1). The combination of API maturity and performance work makes February the most consequential month yet for the embedded database feature since its debut.\n\n## Single Executable Applications Now Support ESM\n\nNode.js 25.7.0 extended Single Executable Applications (SEA) to support ECMAScript module entry points — a change that [the release notes](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v25.7.0) mark as a semver-minor addition. Previously, SEA bundles required a CommonJS entry point, a restriction that excluded projects already fully committed to ESM. The update removes that constraint, letting developers ship self-contained Node.js binaries from modern module-based codebases without reverting to legacy module syntax.\n\n## SIMD-Accelerated Text Encoding in 25.6.0\n\nNode.js 25.6.0, released on February 3, brought a meaningful performance improvement to `TextEncoder.encode()` by routing the operation through the `simdutf` library, according to [the 25.6.0 release notes](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v25.6.0). SIMD — Single Instruction, Multiple Data — allows the CPU to process multiple data elements in parallel, and `simdutf` has already been used in Node.js for UTF-8 decoding; the 25.6.0 release extends the same technique to the encoding path. The same release applied `simdutf` to one-byte string UTF-8 writes in the 25.6.1 follow-up, according to [the patch notes](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v25.6.1).\n\nAdditional 25.6.0 additions include initial ESM support in the embedder API — allowing projects that embed Node.js to load native ES modules — along with new `setTOS()` and `getTOS()` methods on `net.Socket` for Type of Service flag control, and a `bytes()` consumer method added to `node:stream/consumers`.\n\n## HTTP/2 and Test Runner in 25.7.0\n\nBeyond SQLite and SEA, Node.js 25.7.0 added `http1Options` to HTTP/2 connection configuration, enabling developers to tune HTTP/1 fallback behavior during protocol negotiation. The file system module gained a `throwIfNoEntry` option for `fs.stat()` and `fs.promises.stat()`, providing a cleaner alternative to catch-and-check patterns when testing for a file's existence.\n\nThe built-in test runner — `node:test` — received a small but useful improvement: it now displays interrupted tests when the process receives SIGINT, giving developers immediate visibility into which suites were cut short when they hit Ctrl+C during a long test run.\n\n## Native TypeScript Trajectory\n\nSeparate from the point releases, February underscored how far Node.js's native TypeScript execution has come. According to [NodeSource](https://nodesource.com/blog/Node.js-Supports-TypeScript-Natively), the type-stripping loader that lets developers run `.ts` files without a separate transpilation step was introduced in Node.js 23.6 and subsequently stabilized in the 25.x series. The feature works by stripping type annotations at load time rather than fully compiling them, meaning TypeScript constructs with runtime semantics — enums, namespaces, decorators — remain unsupported. For projects that use only erasable type syntax, however, the loader eliminates the need for `ts-node`, `tsx`, or a separate build step entirely.\n\nThis trajectory places Node.js in direct conversation with Deno and Bun, both of which have offered native TypeScript execution for years, and puts pressure on the toolchain ecosystem to adapt to a world where TypeScript processing is increasingly a runtime concern rather than a build-time one.\n\n## Dependency Housekeeping\n\nAll three February releases updated the npm client bundled with Node.js — from 11.9.0 in 25.6.0, to 11.9.0 again in the 25.6.1 patch, and finally to 11.10.1 in 25.7.0. OpenSSL was updated to 3.5.5 in 25.6.0, and llhttp moved to 9.3.1 in 25.7.0. The `cjs-module-lexer` dependency was replaced with the `merve` library in 25.6.1, reflecting ongoing maintenance of the CommonJS module resolution path even as ESM adoption continues to grow.\n\nNode.js 24.x, the current Active LTS branch, received parallel maintenance releases throughout the month; developers on long-term support tracks receive security and stability backports but not the new semver-minor features landing on Current."
