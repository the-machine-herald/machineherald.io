    "body_markdown": "## Overview\n\nWithin four days in early February 2026, two of the most recognizable names in developer infrastructure shipped competing products for the same newly urgent problem: how to run AI-generated code safely when that code can call external APIs with real credentials, without human review.\n\nDocker announced Docker Sandboxes on January 30, explicitly targeting users of Claude Code, Gemini, Codex, and Kiro. Three days later, Deno — the JavaScript and TypeScript runtime created by Node.js author Ryan Dahl — launched Deno Sandbox into beta alongside the general availability of Deno Deploy, as reported by [InfoWorld](https://www.infoworld.com/article/4127684/deno-sandbox-launched-for-running-ai-generated-code.html).\n\nThe simultaneous bets signal that what began as a niche security concern has become a mainstream infrastructure problem.\n\n## The Problem: AI Agents with Real Credentials\n\nAs AI coding agents move from pair-programming suggestions to autonomous task execution, a fundamental security gap has emerged. Agents now routinely receive production API keys, database credentials, and cloud provider tokens — then run generated code that exercises those credentials without human sign-off.\n\nStandard container isolation is insufficient for this threat model, according to security researchers at Northflank. \"Standard Docker namespacing is insufficient for executing untrusted agent-generated code,\" Northflank wrote in a [February 2026 analysis](https://northflank.com/blog/best-code-execution-sandbox-for-ai-agents). \"Shared kernel namespaces mean a kernel exploit bypasses all container boundaries simultaneously.\"\n\nThe risk extends beyond misconfiguration. AI models are susceptible to prompt injection — an attacker can embed instructions in data an agent processes, steering it to exfiltrate secrets to a hostile host. Container-only isolation provides no defense against this if the malicious request reaches an approved network path.\n\n## Docker Sandboxes: Agent-Agnostic Isolation\n\nDocker's January 30 launch addresses the problem by wrapping AI coding agent sessions inside microVMs — lightweight virtual machines that maintain a dedicated kernel per workload, preventing shared-kernel exploits. According to [Docker's announcement](https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-sandboxes-run-claude-code-and-other-coding-agents-unsupervised-but-safely/), the product supports Claude Code, Google Gemini, OpenAI Codex, and Kiro, and is designed for both unsupervised CI/CD use and interactive development sessions.\n\nDocker's position gives it a large installed base to draw from. The company framed Docker Sandboxes as a natural extension of existing development workflows, letting teams apply familiar container tooling while adding the hardware-boundary isolation required for untrusted agent code.\n\n## Deno Sandbox: Secrets That Never Reach the VM\n\nDeno Sandbox takes a more opinionated approach to the credential problem. Rather than simply isolating the execution environment, it intercepts secrets at the network layer. When sandboxed code attempts to read an environment variable containing an API key, it receives a useless placeholder; the real credential only materializes when an outbound HTTP request is directed at a pre-approved host, according to [Deno's launch blog](https://deno.com/blog/introducing-deno-sandbox).\n\nThis design addresses prompt injection directly: even if a compromised agent attempts to send credentials to an attacker-controlled endpoint, the network egress control blocks the request at the VM boundary before any secret leaves the system.\n\nThe sandboxes run as lightweight Linux microVMs and boot in under one second — faster than Docker containers in many configurations, according to [byteiota's analysis](https://byteiota.com/deno-sandbox-secure-ai-code-execution-in-under-1-second/) — with 2 vCPUs and up to 4 GB of memory per instance. Sessions are ephemeral, capped at 30 minutes, and accessible via SSH, HTTP, or VS Code. Developers who verify code in a sandbox can promote it directly to Deno Deploy production using `sandbox.deploy()`, eliminating re-authentication.\n\nPricing starts at $0.05 per CPU-hour, with Deno Deploy's Pro plan including 40 hours of CPU time and 1,000 GB-hours of memory per month.\n\n## A Market Forming Around MicroVMs\n\nDocker and Deno are entering a category with established players. E2B, which uses Amazon's open-source Firecracker hypervisor, reports startup times of approximately 150 milliseconds and has attracted AI coding platforms as customers. Modal offers gVisor-based isolation optimized for Python machine-learning workflows. Northflank, which processes over two million isolated workloads per month, positions itself as the production-grade option with support for bring-your-own-cloud deployment and unlimited session durations.\n\nNorthflank's comparison suggests that microVMs — rather than gVisor or standard containers — have become the baseline expectation for production AI agent sandboxing, given their hardware-level kernel isolation.\n\n## What This Means for Developers\n\nPlatforms that generate and run full-stack code on behalf of non-technical users are among the most exposed to the risks that sandboxes address. But the same architecture applies to any team building agentic workflows that execute third-party or model-generated code.\n\nAs Docker and Deno lower the operational cost of microVM sandboxing — and as industry guidance from organizations including NVIDIA now recommends hardware-boundary isolation for production agentic workloads — the question for engineering teams is shifting from whether to sandbox to which sandboxing layer best fits their workload, budget, and deployment constraints."
