The system ran more than 36,000 unique reaction compositions across 580 microtiter plates, generating roughly 150,000 data points and ultimately producing superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP) at $422 per gram — a 40 percent reduction from the previous benchmark of $698 per gram [1][2]. The results, posted as a preprint on bioRxiv, amount to one of the first public demonstrations of a large language model running a sustained, closed-loop scientific campaign in a real wet lab [3].\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe setup paired GPT-5 with Ginkgo's Reconfigurable Automation Carts (RACs), modular robotic stations controlled by Ginkgo's Catalyst automation software. In each cycle, GPT-5 proposed a batch of experimental designs as digital files, which were validated against a Pydantic schema checking plate layout, reagent availability, volume constraints, and replication protocols before robotic execution. After each round of experiments, results were fed back to the model, which analyzed the data, generated hypotheses, and designed the next round [2][4].\n\nThe model's access was expanded over the course of the campaign. In the first two rounds, GPT-5 designed reaction compositions relying solely on knowledge stored in its training weights, without any prior experimental data or external literature. Starting in Round 3, it gained access to a computer, the internet, data analysis packages, and — critically — a preprint from Northwestern University researchers that had established the $698-per-gram benchmark [5]. From that point on, GPT-5 was able to combine its own experimental results with insights from the published literature. Within two months spanning Rounds 3 through 5, the system surpassed the previous state of the art [5]. By the end of the six-round campaign, it had also achieved a 27 percent improvement in protein yield (from 2.39 to 3.04 grams per liter) and a 57 percent reduction in reagent costs specifically [3][5].\n\nHuman involvement was limited largely to reagent preparation, plate loading and unloading, and system oversight. GPT-5 generated human-readable lab notebook entries documenting its reasoning at each step [2].\n\n## Unexpected Findings\n\nPerhaps the most striking result was that during the early rounds — before receiving the Northwestern preprint — GPT-5 independently proposed reagents including nucleoside monophosphates, potassium phosphate, and ribose that matched findings from the Northwestern group's research. The model appeared to extract relevant domain knowledge from its training data and apply it to generate novel hypotheses in the experimental context [4][5].\n\nGPT-5 also identified reaction compositions that human researchers had not previously tested in this configuration, optimizing for lysate and DNA template costs — the most expensive inputs — by boosting protein yield per unit of those components [4].\n\n## What Tempers the Claims\n\nThe headline results come with significant caveats. All experiments used a single well-characterized benchmark protein, sfGFP, and transferability to other targets remains unproven. When the team attempted CFPS with 12 additional proteins, only six were detectable via gel electrophoresis [5].\n\nThe system also required more human intervention than the \"autonomous\" framing suggests. Lab staff manually adjusted reagent concentrations to reduce measurement variability from over 40 percent to a 17 percent median coefficient of variation. Two of the 480 plates executed contained design flaws — including unit conversion errors — amounting to a less-than-one-percent error rate that nonetheless required human detection and correction [5].\n\nThe work is available only as a preprint and has not undergone peer review [3]. And an important benchmark caveat: a Northwestern group reported CFPS costs as low as $36–$55 per gram at bench scale using oxygenation techniques in a different format, meaning the $422-per-gram figure is the state of the art specifically within automated 384-well plate workflows, not across all CFPS methods [4][5]. Additionally, because the DNA template and cell lysate were improved at the same time as the AI-optimized reaction mix, isolating the model's precise contribution to the cost reduction is difficult [5].\n\n## Commercial and Strategic Context\n\nGinkgo is already selling the AI-improved cell-free reaction mix through its reagents store, signaling that it views the result as commercially viable rather than purely academic [2]. The move aligns with Ginkgo's broader pivot toward positioning its cloud laboratory infrastructure as a service — a strategy that becomes more compelling if autonomous AI systems can drive experimental design without dedicated human scientists at each step.\n\n\"By pairing a frontier large language model with an autonomous lab, we found reaction compositions that are notably cheaper than prior state of the art,\" said Ginkgo co-founder Reshma Shetty [2]. Joy Jiao, OpenAI's life sciences lead, said that \"this was the first time we were able to interface a frontier model with an autonomous lab to carry out experimentation at a very large scale,\" adding that the work \"points to how AI systems can augment the experimental workflow, contributing to hypothesis generation, testing, and refinement\" [2]. Ginkgo CEO Jason Kelly framed the result in geopolitical terms, arguing that \"AI combined with autonomous labs is needed to keep the United States competitive in science worldwide\" [2].\n\n## What We Don't Know\n\nThe preprint references OpenAI's Preparedness Framework for biosecurity evaluation but does not name specific risk mitigation measures beyond that statement [5]. Whether the approach generalizes to therapeutically or industrially relevant proteins — rather than a fluorescent reporter protein used as a benchmark — is an open question. The long-term economics also remain unclear: the six-month, 36,000-experiment campaign required substantial infrastructure, and it is not yet evident whether the cost savings in reagents offset the compute and lab automation expenses.\n\nThe work nonetheless represents a concrete, measurable step toward AI-driven autonomous science — one that produced a commercially available product, even as the scientific claims await peer review.\n\n---\n\n**Sources:**\n\n[1] OpenAI, \"GPT-5 lowers the cost of cell-free protein synthesis,\" February 5, 2026.\n\n[2] PR Newswire / Ginkgo Bioworks, \"Ginkgo Bioworks' Autonomous Laboratory Driven by OpenAI's GPT-5 Achieves 40% Improvement Over State-of-the-Art Scientific Benchmark,\" February 5, 2026.\n\n[3] bioRxiv, \"Using a GPT-5-driven autonomous lab to optimize the cost and titer of cell-free protein synthesis,\" February 5, 2026.\n\n[4] R&D World, \"OpenAI's GPT-5 autonomously ran 36,000 protein synthesis experiments in Ginkgo Bioworks' cloud lab,\" February 2026.\n\n[5] The Decoder, \"OpenAI and Ginkgo Bioworks build an autonomous lab where GPT-5 calls the shots,\" February 2026."
