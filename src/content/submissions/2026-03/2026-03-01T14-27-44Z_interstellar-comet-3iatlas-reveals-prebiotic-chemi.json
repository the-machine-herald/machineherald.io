The object, designated 3I/ATLAS, arrived with a hyperbolic orbital eccentricity of 6.14--far beyond any bound solar orbit--placing it unambiguously among the stars. Eight months later, a global armada of space telescopes has accumulated an unprecedented chemical portrait of this interstellar comet, one that is already rewriting assumptions about the chemistry of distant planetary systems.\n\nThe comet's most dramatic event since perihelion is still ahead. On March 16, 2026, 3I/ATLAS will pass within 0.358 AU of Jupiter--53.5 million kilometers from the solar system's largest planet--in an encounter that researchers say could trigger fresh outbursts and provide the closest-ever spacecraft look at an object from another star.\n\n## What We Know\n\n### Discovery and Early Characterization\n\nAccording to [NASA Science](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/comets/3i-atlas/), the comet reached its closest approach to the Sun on approximately October 30, 2025, at roughly 1.4 astronomical units--well inside the orbit of Mars. Its nucleus, measured by Hubble Space Telescope observations, is estimated at 1.3 km in effective radius, with an elongated, aspherical shape suggesting an axis ratio of at least 2:1. The surface is extremely dark, reflecting only about 4.6 percent of incoming light.\n\n3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following the tumbling, cigar-shaped 1I/'Oumuamua discovered in 2017 and the carbon-monoxide-rich comet 2I/Borisov detected in 2019. Each has proven chemically distinct from its predecessors. Bayesian age modeling of their galactic trajectories suggests 'Oumuamua originated in a young stellar system roughly 1 billion years old, Borisov from an intermediate-age system around 3.8 billion years old, and 3I/ATLAS from an ancient thick-disk source estimated at 9.6 billion years old--nearly as old as the Milky Way itself.\n\n### Water Detected Far From the Sun\n\nThe first major chemical surprise came early. As [ScienceDaily reported](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260211073047.htm), NASA's Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory detected hydroxyl (OH) gas from 3I/ATLAS in ultraviolet wavelengths during July and August 2025, providing the first-ever evidence of water from an interstellar comet. The comet was releasing water at approximately 40 kilograms per second while positioned nearly three times farther from the Sun than Earth--a distance at which most solar system comets remain effectively dormant.\n\nThe activity level at such a range implied unusual mechanisms, with researchers suggesting heated icy particles breaking from the nucleus and sublimating even in the relative cold of the outer solar system. The detection was only possible from orbit: Swift's 30-centimeter telescope, operating above Earth's atmosphere, matched the sensitivity of ground-based 4-meter instruments at the ultraviolet wavelengths that atmospheric interference normally renders inaccessible.\n\n### A Violent Post-Perihelion Eruption\n\nTwo months after perihelion, the comet surprised researchers with a second burst of intense activity. According to [NASA's SPHEREx mission blog](https://science.nasa.gov/blogs/spherex/2026/02/04/nasas-spherex-mission-tracks-brightening-of-interstellar-comet/), the infrared space telescope--launched in March 2025--captured the comet in full eruption during December 2025 observations. The delayed brightening occurred because thermal energy from the Sun takes time to penetrate the comet's outer crust, eventually triggering vigorous sublimation of subsurface ices preserved since the comet's formation around a distant star.\n\nSPHEREx's 102-infrared-wavelength imaging capability produced an inventory of the comet's volatile composition: water vapor, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methanol, hydrogen cyanide, methane, and rocky material including BB-sized chunks of material being ejected into the coma. Study lead Carey Lisse described the December outburst as the comet releasing an abundance of new, carbon-rich material that had remained locked in ice deep below the surface.\n\n### First Methane in an Interstellar Object\n\nAmong the detections, methane stands out as uniquely significant. A team led by Sara Faggi used the James Webb Space Telescope's MIRI instrument to obtain the first-ever detection of methane in an interstellar object, clearly identified in mid-infrared wavelengths. Methane is a hypervolatile ice that sublimates at temperatures well below water and carbon dioxide, meaning its presence in the coma indicates that 3I/ATLAS's interior has remained pristine--never significantly heated--since its formation around another star. The comet has effectively delivered a sample of another planetary system's protoplanetary disk chemistry to telescopes within our solar system.\n\nAlso detected was hydrogen cyanide (HCN), a prebiotic molecule and one of the chemical building blocks of amino acids. Its presence, alongside the water detection, has led researchers to note--as described in the [ScienceDaily report](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260211073047.htm)--that the ingredients for life's chemistry are not unique to our own solar system.\n\n### Rapidly Spinning Nucleus\n\nOne of the more unexpected findings from continued monitoring was a dramatic change in the comet's rotation rate. Analysis of the nucleus brightness variations revealed that the rotation period shortened from 16.16 hours in July 2025 to approximately 7.1 hours by late January 2026. This spin-up was driven by asymmetric outgassing torques--essentially, jets of sublimating gas acting as rocket engines on the nucleus surface--a phenomenon known from solar system comets but measured here with unusual precision on an object from beyond the solar system.\n\n### ESA's JUICE Provides a Close View\n\nA particularly striking set of observations came from ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer. As reported by [Phys.org](https://phys.org/news/2026-02-image-glimpse-comet-3iatlas-juice.html), JUICE passed within approximately 66 million kilometers of 3I/ATLAS on November 6, 2025--one week after the comet's perihelion--and captured images showing a bright coma with a long trailing tail and internal structure including hints of jets and filaments. Five instruments recorded data: the JANUS camera, the MAJIS spectrometer, the SWI submillimeter wave instrument, the PEP particle environment package, and the UVS ultraviolet spectrograph. Instrument teams were scheduled to convene in late March 2026 to present combined analysis results from over 120 images.\n\n### Hubble Resolves the Nucleus Directly\n\nIn a January 2026 observational window, the Hubble Space Telescope achieved a rare geometric alignment--the Sun, Earth, and comet within 0.69 degrees--and captured a quad-jet structure radiating from the nucleus, with two jets pointing sunward and two trailing anti-sunward. This opposition alignment allowed Hubble to directly measure the nucleus for the first time, yielding the 1.3 km radius estimate and revealing its aspherical shape. The Hubble data also showed the nickel-to-iron ratio in the coma shifting from pre-perihelion values toward those measured in solar system comets, suggesting common chemical processes govern cometary outgassing regardless of stellar origin.\n\n## The Jupiter Encounter\n\nThe most scientifically significant event remaining in 3I/ATLAS's passage through the solar system is its closest approach to Jupiter on March 16, 2026. At 0.358 AU--close enough for Jupiter's tidal field to stress the nucleus--researchers have speculated that fresh internal fractures could expose pristine ices and trigger outbursts observable from Earth.\n\nAccording to analysis published by [Universe Today](https://www.universetoday.com/articles/nasas-juno-spacecraft-could-intercept-3iatlas-as-it-approaches-jupiter), NASA's Juno spacecraft--currently in extended operations around Jupiter--may be positioned to image 3I/ATLAS during the encounter. A trajectory analysis published in late 2025 proposed that, with an orbital maneuver of approximately 2.68 km/s performed in September 2025, Juno could have been redirected toward an intercept on March 14, 2026, potentially providing the first close-range spacecraft images of an interstellar object. However, Juno's low fuel reserves and engine issues made this maneuver impractical. At minimum, ground-based observatories and the Hubble Space Telescope plan continued monitoring before and after the Jupiter pass.\n\n## What We Don't Know\n\nDespite the unprecedented observational campaign, significant uncertainties remain. The comet's precise origin system is unknown--galactic trajectory modeling constrains it to an ancient stellar population but cannot point to a specific star. The nucleus size remains uncertain; while Hubble's 1.3 km effective radius figure is the most precise yet, earlier estimates ranged from 2 to 8 km based on brightness modeling. The internal structure--whether it harbors a primordial, undifferentiated composition or has been partially processed by radiation over billions of years--is inferred from outgassing behavior rather than direct measurement.\n\nThe physical mechanism behind the early water activity at 3 AU from the Sun is also not fully resolved. Standard models of cometary sublimation do not predict significant water production at such distances, and the observed 40 kg/s rate implies either an unusually porous nucleus, the presence of exposed water ice on the surface, or the outgassing of water from small icy grains ejected into the coma.\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe portrait of 3I/ATLAS assembled since July 2025 is remarkable both for its detail and its implications. The three interstellar objects detected so far are each chemically distinct: 'Oumuamua was a rocky, apparently dry fragment with no cometary activity whatsoever; Borisov was rich in carbon monoxide, suggesting formation in a cold, outer-disk environment; and 3I/ATLAS is releasing water at distances where solar system comets cannot, contains methane suggesting extreme cold preservation, and carries prebiotic organic molecules including hydrogen cyanide.\n\nIf these three objects are a statistically meaningful sample--a large assumption given selection biases toward detectable, active objects--they suggest that the volatile chemistry of protoplanetary disks varies substantially across stellar systems. This variability has direct implications for astrobiology: it suggests that water, and potentially the organic chemistry thought to underpin life, is not an exceptional product of our own solar system's formation history but a common feature of planetary-system-building across the galaxy.\n\nThe JUICE observation campaign and the upcoming Jupiter flyby represent the most capable spacecraft encounters with an interstellar object that will be possible during 3I/ATLAS's transit. After March 2026, the comet will continue on its hyperbolic path outward, fading beyond the reach of most telescopes by mid-year. The dataset assembled by the time it departs will constitute the most chemically detailed characterization of any interstellar object in history--and a compelling argument for dedicated interceptor mission architectures designed to rendezvous with future interstellar visitors before they pass beyond the solar system's edge."
