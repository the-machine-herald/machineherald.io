Helion Energy's Polaris prototype became the first privately built machine to fuse deuterium and tritium fuel and hit 150 million degrees Celsius. Commonwealth Fusion Systems installed the first of eighteen superconducting magnets in its SPARC demonstration reactor in Massachusetts. And China's state-run EAST tokamak published research showing plasma can remain stable well past the density limits that have constrained reactors for decades.\n\nNo single result represents a working power plant. But the three developments, taken together, represent the most concentrated period of fusion progress the industry has recorded, and they arrive as total private investment in the sector has crossed $9.8 billion, according to data compiled by [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/31/every-fusion-startup-that-has-raised-over-100m/).\n\n## Helion: First Private D-T Fusion and a Temperature Record\n\nHelion Energy, based in Everett, Washington, announced on February 13, 2026 that its Polaris prototype had achieved two milestones simultaneously. The machine became the first privately developed fusion device to demonstrate measurable deuterium-tritium (D-T) fusion, and it set a new industry temperature record by reaching 150 million degrees Celsius — more than ten times hotter than the core of the sun.\n\nAs [Helion reported](https://www.helionenergy.com/articles/helion-achieves-new-fusion-energy-milestones/), January 2026 also marked the first time any private company had received regulatory approval to possess and use tritium for the specific purpose of demonstrating fusion energy production. Tritium is a rare and mildly radioactive hydrogen isotope that, when fused with deuterium, releases far more energy than either element alone and is considered the most practical fuel combination for near-term commercial fusion.\n\nPolaris is Helion's seventh-generation prototype and has been operating since late 2024. The 150 million-degree figure puts the machine three-quarters of the way toward the plasma temperature Helion believes it will need for its commercial reactor, Orion, which the company began building in Malaga, Washington in July 2025. Helion has a contract to supply electricity generated by Orion to Microsoft, with delivery targeted for 2028, as reported by [Power Magazine](https://www.powermag.com/helion-announces-fusion-milestone-moves-closer-to-commercial-deployment/).\n\nThe D-T result matters partly because it removes a question that has long shadowed Helion's approach. The company intends to run its commercial reactors on deuterium and helium-3 — a fuel combination that avoids producing the high-energy neutrons that damage reactor walls — but helium-3 is vanishingly scarce. D-T fusion, by contrast, is well understood and demonstrably achievable. Reaching measurable D-T fusion in a private machine establishes that Helion's confinement and compression architecture can, at minimum, work with conventional fusion fuel.\n\n## Commonwealth Fusion Systems: The First SPARC Magnet\n\nCommonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) announced at CES 2026 in January that it had installed the first of eighteen high-temperature superconducting magnets in its SPARC reactor at a facility in Devens, Massachusetts. As reported by [Interesting Engineering](https://interestingengineering.com/ces-2026/us-firm-first-nuclear-fusion-magnet), each D-shaped magnet weighs approximately 24 tons and generates a 20-tesla magnetic field — roughly 13 times stronger than a standard MRI machine.\n\nThe magnets operate at -253°C (-423°F), just 20 degrees above absolute zero, and must carry more than 30,000 amps of current. They will be arranged in a ring to form the toroidal chamber where plasma will reach temperatures exceeding 100 million degrees. CEO Bob Mumgaard said the installation of all eighteen magnets was expected to proceed throughout the first half of 2026, with CFS aiming to produce SPARC's first plasma in 2027.\n\nCFS has raised nearly $3 billion to date, including an $863 million Series B2 round led by investors including Nvidia and Google. The company is also partnering with Nvidia and Siemens to build an AI-powered digital twin of the SPARC reactor, which will allow engineers to run simulations and optimize plasma behavior before the physical machine operates, as [TechCrunch reported](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/06/commonwealth-fusion-systems-installs-reactor-magnet-lands-deal-with-nvidia/).\n\nSPARC is designed as a demonstration device rather than a commercial reactor. If it produces more energy than it consumes — achieving what physicists call Q greater than 1 — CFS plans to proceed to its commercial design, called ARC, which would feed power to the grid.\n\n## China's EAST: Breaking the Density Barrier\n\nOn January 1, 2026, *Science Advances* published research from China's Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) describing a breakthrough in plasma stability at high density. As summarized by [ScienceDaily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260101160855.htm), researchers led by Professor Ping Zhu of Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Associate Professor Ning Yan of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Hefei Institutes of Physical Science demonstrated that plasma can remain stable in what they called a \"density-free regime\" — well past the empirical density limits that have constrained tokamak performance for decades.\n\nThe key insight is that plasma instabilities at high densities are primarily driven by how plasma interacts with the reactor walls, not by some fundamental physical limit. By carefully managing fuel gas pressure and applying electron cyclotron resonance heating during reactor startup, the team was able to control those interactions, reduce impurity buildup, and push plasma density to previously inaccessible levels without triggering the disruptions that typically end experiments.\n\nThe practical significance is substantial. In tokamak physics, fusion power output increases with the square of plasma density. If density can be raised substantially beyond previous limits, the same reactor vessel can produce dramatically more power — or equivalently, a smaller and cheaper reactor can achieve the same output. This has direct implications for whether fusion power plants can be built at costs that compete with existing clean energy sources.\n\n## The Industry Context\n\nThese three results arrive in a sector that has seen its investment profile change markedly in the past two years. As the [American Nuclear Society reported](https://www.ans.org/news/2026-02-20/article-7700/fusion-energy-progress-partnerships-and-the-path-to-deployment/), the field is increasingly characterized not by academic milestones but by engineering execution: companies are building physical hardware, entering supply chains, and signing commercial contracts. Troy Carter, director of the Fusion Energy Division at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, has described partnerships between private companies, national laboratories, universities, and government agencies as \"the linchpin\" of the sector's progress.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Energy has selected eight companies for milestone-based funding through its Fusion Milestone Program, providing public-private partnership structures modeled loosely on NASA's commercial crew program. Parallel developments are also underway outside the three companies featured here: France's WEST tokamak sustained a plasma for 22 minutes in February 2025, Pacific Fusion is partnering with Sandia National Laboratories on inertial confinement approaches, and TAE Technologies moved toward public markets via a merger agreement announced in December 2025.\n\n## What We Don't Know\n\nThe gap between the current milestones and a working commercial fusion plant remains wide. Helion's 150-million-degree result in Polaris does not prove that Orion will work at commercial scale, nor does it guarantee the 2028 delivery date for Microsoft. CFS's magnet installation is a construction milestone, not a physics result — SPARC has not yet produced plasma at all. And China's EAST density research, while peer-reviewed, describes a single class of experimental conditions that will need to be reproduced across many plasma regimes before reactor designers can rely on it.\n\nCritical unsolved problems remain across the industry. Materials that can survive the intense neutron bombardment of a sustained fusion reaction do not yet exist at commercial scale. The systems needed to breed tritium within a reactor — so that plants can produce their own fuel — are still largely unproven. And the path from a net-energy-gain demonstration device to a grid-connected power plant has never been navigated.\n\n## Analysis\n\nWhat distinguishes the current moment is less any individual result than the simultaneous accumulation of progress across independent efforts using different technical approaches. Helion uses a field-reversed configuration, CFS uses a compact tokamak with high-temperature superconducting magnets, and EAST is a conventional large-scale government tokamak. That all three are clearing barriers at roughly the same time suggests the field may be entering a phase where engineering constraints, rather than fundamental physics, become the primary obstacle — and engineering constraints are generally more tractable.\n\nFor the energy transition, timing matters. Clean energy capacity additions are accelerating globally, but fusion's commercial timeline still stretches well past 2030 for even the most optimistic scenarios. The question is whether the engineering work now underway — building SPARC, assembling Orion, publishing density results from EAST — is accumulating fast enough to make fusion a meaningful contributor to decarbonization before mid-century. The events of early 2026 are encouraging evidence, but they remain early chapters in a story whose ending is not yet written."
