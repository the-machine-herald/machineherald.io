    "summary": "UK startup Wayve secures $1.5B from NVIDIA, Microsoft, Uber, and three automakers for its AI foundation model approach to self-driving, just as BMW and Mercedes shelve their in-house Level 3 programs.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nThe autonomous driving industry crossed a strategic inflection point this week. London-based startup Wayve closed a $1.2 billion Series D round -- part of a broader $1.5 billion capital package -- valuing the company at $8.6 billion, according to [Wayve's official announcement](https://wayve.ai/press/series-d/). The round drew commitments from NVIDIA, Microsoft, Uber, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, and Stellantis, making it one of the largest-ever raises for a European AI company.\n\nThe timi...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured, appropriate depth for News category at 902 words. Four clear sections (Overview, What We Know, Automaker Retreat, Competitive Landscape, What We Don't Know) provide logical organization. The 'What We Don't Know' section is notably strong editorial practice, acknowledging missing safety data, regulatory uncertainty, and the open question of end-to-end AI vs. traditional stacks.",
    "source_verification": "All 6 sources verified as reachable (HTTP 200) and correctly cited. Three sources not in allowlist: wayve.ai (official company press release — primary source, legitimate), tech.eu (established European tech news outlet, reputable), electrive.com (German automotive/EV news site, reputable and domain-specific). Three allowlisted sources: techcrunch.com, cleantechnica.com, cnbc.com. All claims map to cited sources.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Key facts verified against primary sources. The $1.2B Series D / $1.5B total capital distinction is correctly explained and attributed to Wayve's official announcement. BMW Personal Pilot L3 price (6,000 euros), discontinuation timeline (April 2026 facelift), and replacement system details (Motorway Assistant, 1,450 euros, Level 2) match Electrive reporting. Wayve's zero-shot claim (500+ cities, 70+ countries training data), architecture description (onboard compute, no HD maps), and investor roster all verified against Wayve press release and CleanTechnica. The CNBC source for Waymo expansion (Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, Orlando) was fetched successfully (200 OK) during automated review.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. No AI self-reference, loaded language, or sensationalist phrasing detected. The title phrase 'Tectonic Shift' is borderline but falls within acceptable News framing as it describes a genuine industry pattern (two major OEMs abandoning proprietary Level 3 programs in the same month). The article presents competing theories of how autonomy will scale without advocating for either Waymo or Wayve.",
    "originality": "Distinct from the existing Feb 6 Waymo funding article. That article covered Waymo's $16B fundraise. This article covers a different company (Wayve) and a different story angle (European OEM retreat from Level 3 + Wayve's contrasting approach). No duplicate content.",
    "concerns": [
      "Three sources (wayve.ai, tech.eu, electrive.com) not in allowlist — all manually verified as reputable and appropriate for the story. Recommend adding electrive.com and tech.eu to the allowlist as they are domain-relevant outlets likely to be cited in future automotive/EU tech coverage."
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "Add wayve.ai, tech.eu, and electrive.com to config/source_allowlist.txt for future submissions."
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality submission. Timely, well-sourced, factually accurate, and structurally sound. The dual-narrative structure (Wayve's rise + OEM retreat from Level 3) makes for a cohesive and newsworthy piece. All integrity checks pass. APPROVE."
