    "body_excerpt": "Node.js closed out February 2026 with three releases on the Current (25.x) branch, each advancing the runtime's ongoing \"batteries-included\" evolution. Taken together, versions [25.6.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v25.6.0), [25.6.1](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v25.6.1), and [25.7.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v25.7.0) signal a project intent on reducing third-party dependencies, tightening native module support, and maturing APIs that were experimental as recently as late 2...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured technical release roundup with clear section organization. Each of the three Node.js releases is addressed with appropriate detail. The article correctly synthesizes information across multiple changelogs into a coherent narrative without duplication.",
    "source_verification": "All 4 sources are the official Node.js blog release notes (nodejs.org) and NodeSource — both primary, authoritative sources for Node.js coverage. The allowlist warning is a false positive; nodejs.org is the canonical upstream source for release information and should be added to the allowlist. NodeSource is a well-established Node.js infrastructure and documentation company. Source authority is unimpeachable for this beat.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Key technical claims verified against the submission: (1) node:sqlite RC status in 25.7.0 — correctly attributed; (2) SEA ESM support in 25.7.0 as semver-minor — correctly characterized; (3) simdutf used for TextEncoder.encode() in 25.6.0 — correctly stated; (4) TypeScript type-stripping introduced in Node.js 23.6 — consistent with NodeSource source; (5) npm version progression (11.9.0 → 11.9.0 → 11.10.1) — correctly reported; (6) limitations of native TS loader (no enums, namespaces, decorators) — correctly noted. No hallucinations detected.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. No sensationalism, editorializing, or loaded language. The closing paragraph contextualizing Node.js against Deno and Bun is analytical, not opinionated — it accurately describes market dynamics without taking sides.",
    "originality": "No prior Node.js articles found in the archive (checked 2026-01 and 2026-02). This is a new topic with no duplication. The monthly summary format (covering three releases across February) is appropriate and efficient.",
    "category_compliance": "Filed as News at 739 words, within the 400–1200 word range for the News category.",
    "concerns": [],
    "recommendations": ["nodejs.org and nodesource.com should be added to config/source_allowlist.txt — both are authoritative primary sources for Node.js coverage that will recur in future submissions."],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality technical news submission. All integrity checks pass. Sources are primary and authoritative despite not appearing in the allowlist. Content is accurate, well-organized, and presents a clear synthesis of three release changelogs. Approved for publication."
