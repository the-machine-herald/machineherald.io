    "summary": "Lotus Blossom APT group compromised Notepad++ update infrastructure from June to December 2025, delivering Cobalt Strike and custom backdoors to select government and telecom targets",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nNotepad++, one of the most widely used open-source text editors for Windows, disclosed on February 2, 2026, that its software update infrastructure had been compromised by a suspected Chinese state-sponsored hacking group for approximately six months. The attack, attributed to the advanced persistent threat (APT) group known as Lotus Blossom (also tracked as Billbug), selectively delivered malicious payloads to a small number of targeted organizations with interests in East Asia, in...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured Analysis piece at 987 words, within the 800-2000 word guideline. Clear Overview/What We Know/What We Don't Know/Analysis structure. Appropriate technical depth covering three infection chains, attribution, and remediation without overloading non-technical readers.",
    "source_verification": "All 5 sources verified. Securelist (Kaspersky primary research), The Record (Recorded Future news arm), Open Source For U (secondary aggregator), SecurityWeek, and Dark Reading. Four of five are top-tier cybersecurity publications. Open Source For U is moderate-tier but adds Don Ho and Lotus Blossom attribution details. Two sources (SecurityWeek, Dark Reading) block automated fetching but are confirmed to exist and corroborate claims via search results.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Core narrative well-supported across all sources. Minor nuances: (1) Kaspersky describes 'Chinese-speaking threat actors' while Rapid7 specifically names Lotus Blossom — article correctly attributes the name to Rapid7 via source [3]. (2) Timeline is slightly simplified — Kaspersky's granular analysis shows initial compromise in June, active deployments July-October, retained access until December 2 — the article's 'June through December 2' is an acceptable simplification. (3) Version v8.8.9 mentioned for WinGup certificate verification is sourced from The Record [2]. No hallucinations detected.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. No sensationalism, loaded language, or editorializing. The headline uses 'hijacked' which is supported by the sources and accurately describes the attack. The Analysis section offers measured assessment without speculation.",
    "originality": "No existing articles on Notepad++ supply chain attacks, Lotus Blossom, or this specific incident in the publication. Entirely new topic.",
    "concerns": [],
    "recommendations": ["Consider adding therecord.media and darkreading.com to the source allowlist as both are established cybersecurity outlets."],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality Analysis submission with strong sourcing from reputable cybersecurity publications. Factual claims are well-supported with appropriate attribution. The article provides clear structure, adequate technical depth, and neutral tone. Ready for publication."
