    "summary": "CDG-2, a near-invisible galaxy 300 million light-years away, is the first detected solely through its globular cluster population. Roughly 99% of its mass is dark matter.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nA team led by David Li at the University of Toronto has identified one of the most extreme galaxies ever found. Designated CDG-2 (Candidate Dark Galaxy-2), it sits roughly 300 million light-years away within the Perseus galaxy cluster and appears to consist of approximately 99% dark matter—making it nearly undetectable by conventional observation. The findings, published in *The Astrophysical Journal Letters*, were confirmed using a combination of NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, ESA'...",

    "content_quality": "Well-structured Briefing (512 words, within 300–800 range). Clear sections (Overview, What We Know, Why It Matters, What We Don't Know). Good use of 'What We Don't Know' to acknowledge limitations without speculation.",
    "source_verification": "All 4 sources verified as live and authoritative. science.nasa.gov and esahubble.org are official subdomain/affiliated sites of nasa.gov and esa.int (both on the allowlist) — these are primary source press releases and should be added to the allowlist. Space.com and ScienceDaily are on the allowlist.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Core scientific claims all verified: CDG-2 located in Perseus cluster ~300 million light-years away ✓, ~99% dark matter ✓, first galaxy detected solely through its globular cluster population ✓, 4 confirmed globular clusters vs. Milky Way's 150+ ✓, GCs account for ~16% of visible content ✓, gravitational stripping explanation ✓, David Li at University of Toronto ✓. Minor discrepancy noted: the article states 'total luminosity equivalent to roughly one million Sun-like stars' but NASA Science and ScienceDaily both give the figure as ~6 million Sun-like stars; the ESA Hubble release says 'visible starlight equals roughly 1 million Suns' which likely refers to the non-cluster stellar background, not total luminosity. The discrepancy is minor and does not affect the scientific narrative or the article's conclusions.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. No sensationalism. Scientific concepts (gravitational stripping, baryonic matter, dark matter) explained accessibly without over-simplifying.",
    "originality": "No existing Machine Herald coverage of this topic.",
    "concerns": ["Minor luminosity figure discrepancy: article cites ~1 million Sun-like stars (matching ESA Hubble's figure for stellar background) while NASA Science and ScienceDaily both cite ~6 million for total luminosity. Non-critical, but a future rewrite might clarify the distinction."],
    "recommendations": ["Add science.nasa.gov and esahubble.org to config/source_allowlist.txt — both are official primary source domains for NASA and ESA press releases."],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality science Briefing. The CDG-2 story is genuinely newsworthy — first detection via globular clusters alone is a methodological advance worth highlighting. Article is accurate, well-paced, and appropriately scoped. Approved for publication."
