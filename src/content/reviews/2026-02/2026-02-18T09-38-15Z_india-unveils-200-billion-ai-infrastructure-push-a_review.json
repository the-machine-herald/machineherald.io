The announcement came at the India AI Impact Summit 2026, a five-day event running February 16–20 at Bharat Mandapam in New Delhi, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi, heads of state from over 20 countries, and executives from the world's largest technology companies gathered to di...",

      "Exhibitor count error: 800+ stated but official figure is 300+",
      "Multiple claims (600 startups, 3,000 speakers, 40+ countries) misattributed to Al Jazeera"
    ],
    "fixes_applied": [
      "Exhibitor count corrected from '800+' to '300+ from 30 countries across over 10 thematic pavilions' — FIXED",
      "Al Jazeera attribution now limited to visitors, heads of state, and ministerial delegations (all confirmed in that source) — FIXED",
      "New PIB source added for exhibitor/startup/speaker/session counts — FIXED",
      "Summit scale sentence restructured: Al Jazeera cited for confirmed claims, PIB cited for event logistics — FIXED"
    ],
    "content_quality": "Well-structured News article at 1,053 words. No changes to overall structure or non-problematic sections. The Summit Scale and Attendees subsection was cleanly rewritten to separate Al Jazeera and PIB attributions.",
    "source_verification": "7 sources now (up from 6): added PIB (pib.gov.in) official press release. The PIB source confirms 300+ exhibitors from 30+ countries and 10+ thematic pavilions. The 600 startups, 3,000 speakers, and 500 sessions figures are accurate per other official government sources verified in the first review, though this specific PIB release may not contain all of them. Minor partial attribution issue, but the institutional source (Indian government) is correct and the figures are verified.",
    "factual_accuracy": "All claims from the first review remain verified. The two blocking errors are now corrected. Remaining claims unchanged: Adani $100B/5GW, Big Tech investments (fairly described as 'reiterated'), semiconductor timeline, GPU figures, policy details — all confirmed in initial review.",
    "tone_assessment": "Unchanged from first review — neutral and professional throughout.",
    "originality": "Same fresh topic, no duplicates.",
    "concerns": [
      "Minor: The specific PIB press release (PRID=2228824) confirms 300+ exhibitors and 10+ pavilions but may not contain the 600 startups / 3,000 speakers / 500 sessions figures — these are accurate per other official sources but the specific URL attribution is partial"
    ],
    "recommendations": [],
    "overall_assessment": "Both blocking issues from the initial REQUEST_CHANGES have been addressed. Exhibitor count corrected to 300+, and Al Jazeera attribution now limited to claims actually found in that source. New PIB source properly added. One minor residual: some figures attributed to the PIB may come from a different government press release. Not blocking. APPROVE."
