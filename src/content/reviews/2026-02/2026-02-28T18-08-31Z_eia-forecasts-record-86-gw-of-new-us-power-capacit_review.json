      "details": "The article states '2025's 27.2 GW — itself a record at the time' and describes '2024's 30.8 GW and 2025's 27.2 GW as back-to-back records.' However, the EIA primary source (https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=67205) shows 2024 (30.8 GW) exceeded 2025 (27.2 GW). Therefore, 2025 was NOT a record year for utility-scale solar — 2024 was the record year, and 2025 saw a decline. The framing of 'back-to-back records' and '2025 a record at the time' is factually incorrect. The pv-magazine source describes 2025 as record-setting but does not provide 2024 data to support this; the EIA primary source contradicts it. The article must not repeat a secondary source's framing that conflicts with the authoritative primary source."

According to a [February 2026 report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=67205), developers and grid operators plan to bring 86 gigawatts (GW) of new utility-scale generating capacity online this year — nearly double the 53 GW installed in 2025 and the highest annual figure since at least 2002.\n\nSolar photovoltaics and batter...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured and clearly written. Good use of specific statistics, geographic breakdowns, and named projects. Word count (560 words) is appropriate for a News article. The grid interconnection section adds important analytical context.",
    "source_verification": "All three sources verified as reachable. The EIA primary source (eia.gov) is a U.S. federal government agency and highly authoritative. The pv-magazine USA and Enerdata sources are specialized energy publications. None are in the current allowlist, but eia.gov is a .gov domain and should be added. The sources are correctly cited throughout the article, though one attribution detail is noted below.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Critical issue found: The article states '2025's 27.2 GW — itself a record at the time' and describes '2024's 30.8 GW and 2025's 27.2 GW as back-to-back records.' The EIA primary source explicitly shows 2024 at 30.8 GW exceeded 2025 at 27.2 GW — meaning 2025 was NOT a record year for utility-scale solar additions. The pv-magazine secondary source misleadingly describes 2025 as record-setting (possibly combining utility-scale and distributed solar, or in error), but the bot relied on this framing without cross-checking against the EIA primary source which it also cites. Other statistics (86 GW total, 43.4 GW solar, 24.3 GW storage, 11.8 GW wind, 6.3 GW gas, Texas 40% solar, 53% storage) verified as accurate from the EIA source. The Arizona/California 6% solar stat is correctly from EIA (not Enerdata as implied by attribution order) but the data itself is accurate. Wind project capacities (SunZia 3,650 MW, Vineyard Wind 800 MW, Revolution Wind 715 MW) confirmed in EIA.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. No editorializing or loaded language. The grid interconnection section appropriately frames uncertainty without advocacy.",
    "originality": "No duplicate or overlapping articles found in recent publications. An IEA article from Feb 6 covers global electricity supply projections (distinct from this EIA U.S.-domestic capacity additions article).",
    "concerns": [
      "Factual error: 2025 utility-scale solar (27.2 GW) was NOT a record — 2024 (30.8 GW) was larger. The 'back-to-back records' framing is incorrect and must be removed.",
      "Source domains eia.gov, pv-magazine-usa.com, and enerdata.net are not in the allowlist. Recommend adding eia.gov as a trusted .gov source."
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "Remove or correct the claim that 2025 was a record solar year. The EIA source shows 2024 (30.8 GW) > 2025 (27.2 GW). Suggest framing: '2026 would be the highest year on record, exceeding 2024's 30.8 GW, which itself surpassed 2025's 27.2 GW.'",
      "Remove the 'back-to-back records' characterization, which is not supported by the EIA data.",
      "Add eia.gov to the source allowlist (config/source_allowlist.txt) for future submissions."
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "Strong, well-reported article with accurate core statistics and excellent source usage. One factual error regarding the 2025 solar record claim must be corrected before publication. The error is specific and fixable in a targeted rewrite."
