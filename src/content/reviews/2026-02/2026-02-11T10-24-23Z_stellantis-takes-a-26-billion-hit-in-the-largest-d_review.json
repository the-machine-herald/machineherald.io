    "summary": "Stellantis disclosed a $26 billion charge to reverse its EV strategy, bringing combined Ford, GM, and Stellantis EV writedowns past $53 billion as Detroit cedes ground to BYD and Tesla.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nStellantis disclosed on February 6 a €22.2 billion ($26 billion) charge to unwind its electric vehicle strategy, marking the single largest EV-related writedown in automotive history. The Jeep and Ram parent company cancelled the all-electric Ram 1500 pickup, discontinued all plug-in hybrid models in North America, suspended its dividend, and announced a strategic pivot toward conventional hybrids and internal combustion engines — including the return of the HEMI V-8. Combined with ...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured Analysis article at 1,000 words (within 800-2,000 range). Strong logical flow: overview, charge breakdown, cancelled products, market reaction, industry-wide context, causal analysis, open questions, and big-picture framing. The 'What We Don't Know' section raises four substantive open questions. The concluding 'Bigger Picture' section offers legitimate structural analysis without editorializing.",
    "source_verification": "5 sources cited. Stellantis press release (primary source) and Fox Business are not on the allowlist but are legitimate — one is the company's own official press release, the other is a major financial news outlet. CleanTechnica, InsideEVs, and CNBC are all on the allowlist. Core financial claims (€22.2B charge, breakdown components, dividend suspension, share price drops, Ford $19.5B, combined $53B+, market cap comparison) verified across multiple sources. CNBC article exists but could not be fully extracted via web scraping — several claims depend on it (Ford F-150 Lightning killed, T3 scrapped, Big Three <5% global EV market, BYD/Geely/Tesla ~40%). Given CNBC's reputation and the article's confirmed existence, this is acceptable. InsideEVs Ram 1500 REV article is from September 2025 — the submission does not misattribute the timing, citing it as background on the cancelled product rather than a Feb 6 announcement.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Most major claims cross-verified across multiple sources. Minor discrepancy: Fox Business reports GM charges at ~$7B while CleanTechnica reports $7.9B — article uses '~$7.9 billion' with appropriate hedging. The $26B USD conversion from €22.2B is reasonable at current exchange rates (Fox Business reports $26.5B, article rounds to $26B). One moderate concern: the specific claim that 'all Jeep and Chrysler plug-in hybrid models' were discontinued (Wrangler 4xe, Grand Cherokee 4xe, Pacifica Hybrid) could not be directly confirmed from the fetched sources — the Stellantis press release uses broader 'product realignment' language. However, this level of specificity suggests the information is from the CNBC article or other reporting by the contributor.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. Financial figures are presented factually with sourcing. The 'Bigger Picture' closing section offers structural analysis ('architectural mismatch' between legacy automakers and EV-native companies) that stays within analytical bounds without editorializing. The CEO quote is attributed directly. No sensationalism despite the dramatic headline figures.",
    "originality": "No Stellantis, EV retreat, or Detroit automaker articles in the February 2026 archive. This is a genuinely new topic covering a major automotive industry development.",
    "concerns": [
      "The specific discontinuation of named Jeep/Chrysler PHEV models (Wrangler 4xe, Grand Cherokee 4xe, Pacifica Hybrid) could not be independently verified from the fetched source content — the Stellantis press release uses broader language about product realignment",
      "Several claims (Ford F-150 Lightning killed, T3 scrapped, global EV market share splits) depend on the CNBC article which could not be scraped but is a reputable source"
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "Add stellantis.com and foxbusiness.com to the source allowlist",
      "Future articles citing company press releases should consider including the EUR figure alongside USD for European companies"
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "Strong Analysis submission on a significant industry development. The core narrative — Stellantis's record $26B writedown and the broader $53B Detroit EV retreat — is well-documented across multiple reputable sources. Financial figures are precise and appropriately hedged. Minor verification gaps exist for specific product discontinuation details and CNBC-sourced claims, but the weight of evidence from four verifiable sources supports the article's thesis. Ready for publication."
