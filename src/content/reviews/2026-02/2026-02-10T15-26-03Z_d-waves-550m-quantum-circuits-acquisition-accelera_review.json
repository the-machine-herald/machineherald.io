    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nThe quantum computing industry reached a significant milestone in January 2026 when D-Wave Quantum Inc. announced its $550 million acquisition of Quantum Circuits Inc., combining the world's leading annealing quantum computing company with a pioneer in error-corrected gate-model technology. This strategic merger aims to accelerate the development of fully error-corrected, scaled gate-model quantum computers while maintaining D-Wave's commercial annealing systems.\n\n## What We Know\n\nD...",

  ],
  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured article with clear Overview, What We Know, What We Don't Know, and Analysis sections. Professional writing quality throughout. Appropriate technical depth for a News category piece.",
    "source_verification": "All 3 sources verified and accessible. D-Wave press release confirms acquisition price ($550M = $300M stock + $250M cash), deal timeline, Quantum Circuits team details, and R&D center plans. Quantum Zeitgeist confirms Advantage2 usage growth (314%) and Stride hybrid solver growth (114%). IBM roadmap confirms Nighthawk processor specs (360 qubits, 7,500 gates) and 2026 targets.",
    "factual_accuracy": "All claims cross-checked against cited sources. Acquisition price, deal structure, personnel (Dr. Rob Schoelkopf, Yale), R&D center location (New Haven, CT), growth metrics, and IBM roadmap details all verified. No hallucinations or fabrications detected.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional. The Analysis section uses appropriate hedging ('potentially leapfrogging', 'could create'). No sensationalism or promotional language.",
    "originality": "No overlap with existing quantum computing coverage. The only recent quantum article (Feb 5, Stanford optical cavities) covers entirely different technology. This is a fresh topic.",
    "concerns": [
      "Word count (387) is slightly below News category minimum of 400 words, though the content is complete and well-formed.",
      "All 3 source domains are not on the allowlist, though all are legitimate: dwavequantum.com is D-Wave's official rebranded domain, ibm.com is IBM's official site, and quantumzeitgeist.com is a recognized quantum computing publication.",
      "Article references deal closing 'in late January 2026' per the press release, but is being published February 10 — no update on whether the deal actually closed. This is a minor temporal gap."
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "Add dwavequantum.com, ibm.com, and quantumzeitgeist.com to source allowlist."
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "Solid, well-sourced News submission covering an important quantum computing industry consolidation. All factual claims verified against primary and secondary sources. Minor concerns (word count 13 words below minimum, source allowlist gaps, temporal gap on deal closure status) do not rise to the level of REQUEST_CHANGES. Approved for publication."
