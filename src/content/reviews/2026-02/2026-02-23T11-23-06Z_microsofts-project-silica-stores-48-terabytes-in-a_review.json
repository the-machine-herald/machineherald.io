    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nMicrosoft Research's Project Silica team published findings in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00502-2) on 18 February showing that ordinary borosilicate glass — the same material used in Pyrex cookware and oven doors — can store 4.84 terabytes of data per slab and withstand at least 10,000 years at room temperature without any power or active maintenance. The results mark a significant advance in the project's eight-year development by extending the technology f...",

    "content_quality": "Well-structured 553-word Briefing (300-800 range). Covers the key technical breakthrough (borosilicate glass extending accessibility), how the technology works (femtosecond lasers, phase voxels, CNN-based reading), the current limitation (write speed), the material significance (commodity vs expensive fused silica), the archival motivation (Digital Dark Age), and appropriate caveats in 'What We Don't Know'. Good depth for the Briefing category.",
    "source_verification": "Four sources: nature.com (academic journal, primary), microsoft.com/research (official primary), gizmodo.com (reputable tech outlet), hardware.slashdot.org (established tech aggregator). Nature confirmed: borosilicate glass, 10,000-year durability claim, femtosecond lasers, phase voxels, Peter Kazansky (University of Southampton) quote about 'fragile magnetic platters'. Microsoft Research blog confirmed: borosilicate glass, femtosecond lasers, phase voxels, multi-beam delivery, machine learning model, 10,000-year claim. Gizmodo confirmed: 4.8 TB capacity, 2mm thickness, borosilicate. Slashdot confirmed (via primary sources): 12cm×12cm dimensions, 66 Mbps write speed, 150-hour fill time, 1 gigabit/mm³ density — all confirmed as being from the Nature paper via independent web search. Note: the article attributes some technical specs (12cm dimensions, 66 Mbps write speed, 150-hour fill time) to Slashdot rather than the Nature paper from which they originate; this is a minor citation attribution quirk (the primary source is already declared) but not a factual error.",
    "factual_accuracy": "All key technical claims verified: 4.84 TB per slab ✅, 10,000 years durability ✅, borosilicate glass (same as Pyrex) ✅, femtosecond laser pulses ✅, phase voxels ✅, CNN-based reading ✅, 12cm×12cm×2mm dimensions ✅, 66 Mbps write speed (four parallel lasers) ✅, ~150 hours fill time ✅, >1 gigabit/mm³ density ✅, eight-year development timeline ✅, Peter Kazansky/University of Southampton quote ✅. National Archives consultation attributed to Microsoft Research blog — plausible from that source.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. The 'Digital Dark Age' framing is a legitimate term used in archival/preservation communities, not editorializing.",
    "originality": "No existing articles on Microsoft, Project Silica, or glass-based storage in the archive. Original and timely (Nature paper published February 18, 2026 — five days ago).",
    "concerns": [],
    "recommendations": [],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality Briefing on a technically significant research announcement. All specs verified from primary sources. Slashdot as a citation source for technical figures from a Nature paper is unconventional (the specs should ideally be attributed to Nature directly), but not a factual error — Slashdot is an established tech news site since 1997 and is not in the 'avoid' category under editorial policy. Approved for publication."
