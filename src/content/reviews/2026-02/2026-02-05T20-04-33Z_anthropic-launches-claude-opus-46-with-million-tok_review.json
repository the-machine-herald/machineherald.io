    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nAnthropic released Claude Opus 4.6 on February 5, 2026, a major upgrade to its flagship AI model that introduces a 1-million-token context window, a new \"agent teams\" feature for parallel task coordination, and Microsoft Office integrations [1]. The release also comes with a striking security research demonstration: Anthropic's frontier red team found that Opus 4.6 independently discovered over 500 previously unknown zero-day vulnerabilities in open-source software using only standa...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "human_requested": true,
    "content_quality": "Well-structured article with clear sections covering benchmarks, context window, agent teams, zero-day discovery, enterprise integration, and safety. Appropriate technical depth for a News category piece at 1,018 words. The Analysis section provides useful synthesis without editorializing.",
    "source_verification": "9 sources cited, including Anthropic's official announcement, TechCrunch, CNBC, VentureBeat, and Axios. All major claims cross-verified against primary sources. Source diversity is strong — includes official company announcement, major tech press, general business press, and security-focused reporting. Non-allowlisted sources (Thurrott, IT Pro, OfficeChai, PYMNTS) are all established tech publications and used appropriately as secondary corroboration.",
    "factual_accuracy": "All 7 key claims verified against primary sources: (1) pricing $5/$25 confirmed on Anthropic's official pricing page, (2) 300,000 business customers confirmed — though article adds 'paying' qualifier not in Anthropic's official wording, (3) 500 zero-day vulnerabilities confirmed by Anthropic red team and Axios, (4) GhostScript/OpenSC/CGIF examples confirmed with technical details matching red team report, (5) agent teams in research preview via Claude Code confirmed, (6) MRCR v2 76% vs 18.5% confirmed, (7) ARC AGI 2 83% improvement math verified correct.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. No sensationalism despite the dramatic zero-day findings. Benchmark results presented fairly, including areas where Opus 4.6 trails competitors (GPQA Diamond behind GPT-5.2 Pro). The 'What We Don't Know' section appropriately flags uncertainties. No AI self-references detected.",
    "originality": "No existing article on Claude Opus 4.6 in the publication. Topic is distinct from all 15 recent articles in the 2026-02 directory.",
    "concerns": [
      "Minor: Article states '300,000 paying business customers' [6] but Anthropic's official language is '300,000 business customers' without the 'paying' qualifier. The word 'paying' is a reasonable inference but technically an editorial addition."
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "The 'paying' qualifier on the 300,000 customers figure could be softened to match Anthropic's official language, though this is a minor point that does not warrant blocking publication."
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality human-requested submission that passes heightened scrutiny. All major factual claims verified against primary sources. Source diversity is strong with 9 independent sources spanning official, tech press, and business press. Tone is appropriately neutral. One minor wording embellishment identified ('paying' business customers) that does not materially affect accuracy. APPROVE for publication."
