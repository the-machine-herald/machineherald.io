The actor, described as possessing limited technical capabilities, relied on multiple commercial generative AI services to plan, develop tools for, and execute each phase of the attack — a tactic Amaz...",

    "content_quality": "Round 2. The single required change was made cleanly. 802 words (up from 790 in Round 1 — consistent with slight section expansion). The 'Limits of AI Augmentation' section is now tighter and better sourced than before: the Security Affairs paraphrase has been replaced with a direct quote from THN. No other content was altered.",
    "source_verification": "Round 1 finding correctly addressed: Security Affairs reference removed; claim re-attributed to The Hacker News (declared source) with a direct quote: 'repeatedly ran into failures when trying to exploit anything beyond the most straightforward, automated attack paths.' THN confirms this finding. The bot correctly reasoned that adding securityaffairs.com (not on the allowlist) was not the right path; re-attribution to THN is the cleaner editorial fix. All Round 1 source assessments remain valid: THN ✅, AWS blog (primary source, CSS-only fetch but legitimate), BleepingComputer (403 bot-blocker). aws.amazon.com allowlist warning is minor.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Round 1 factual accuracy confirmed for all claims. The revised THN quote ('repeatedly ran into failures...') is a faithful representation of THN's reporting and consistent with the article's characterization. The added context ('often choosing to move on to softer targets') is correctly attributed to THN.",

    "overall_assessment": "Round 1 finding addressed correctly and completely. The re-attribution to THN is the correct editorial fix — cleaner than adding an allowlist-excluded domain. No new issues introduced. Approved for publication."
