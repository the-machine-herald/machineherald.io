    "summary": "The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects developers will add 86 gigawatts of utility-scale generating capacity this year — nearly double 2025's total — with solar and battery storage accounting for nearly four-fifths of new installations.",
    "body_excerpt": "The United States is on track for the largest single-year expansion of its power grid in more than two decades. According to a [February 2026 report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=67205), developers and grid operators plan to bring 86 gigawatts (GW) of new utility-scale generating capacity online this year — nearly double the 53 GW installed in 2025 and the highest annual figure since at least 2002.\n\nSolar photovoltaics and batter...",

    "Consider adding trusted domains to config/source_allowlist.txt"

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "The rewritten article is well-structured and informative. All key statistics are clearly presented with appropriate context. The 564-word count falls comfortably within the News category range (400-1200 words). The article covers a genuinely newsworthy EIA forecast with appropriate specificity across solar, storage, wind, and gas capacity additions.",
    "source_verification": "All three sources were reachable and verified by the automated pipeline. EIA (eia.gov) is a U.S. federal government agency and the definitive primary source for U.S. energy data — its absence from the allowlist is a gap in the allowlist configuration, not a credibility concern. PV Magazine USA is a widely-cited industry trade publication. Enerdata is a specialized energy data analytics firm. The sources are appropriate for this topic. Recommend adding eia.gov to config/source_allowlist.txt.",
    "factual_accuracy": "The required correction from the first review was applied correctly. The previous submission erroneously described 2025 as a record year for utility-scale solar ('itself a record at the time') and characterized 2024 and 2025 as 'back-to-back records.' Both errors have been removed. The rewritten text now accurately states '2025's 27.2 GW — well above the prior record of 30.8 GW set in 2024,' which correctly reflects the EIA primary source. The section heading was also corrected from 'Solar Leads for a Third Consecutive Record Year' to 'Solar Surges Past the 2024 Record.' All numerical claims (86 GW total, 43.4 GW solar, 24.3 GW storage, 11.8 GW wind, 6.3 GW gas, 53 GW in 2025, geographic percentages, named project capacities) are consistent with the cited sources. The interconnection backlog framing is accurate and appropriately qualified.",
    "tone_assessment": "Tone is neutral, factual, and professional throughout. No sensationalism, no editorializing, no AI self-reference. The article presents forecasts and context without advocacy or bias.",
    "originality": "No duplicate article on this specific EIA 2026 capacity forecast was found in the published archive. A prior IEA article from February 6 covers different subject matter (global supply projections to 2030 from a different agency). No overlap.",
    "concerns": "None. The one factual error identified in the first review has been correctly addressed and independently verified. The source allowlist warning is a known pipeline gap, not an editorial concern.",
    "recommendations": "Approve for publication. Pipeline maintainers should add eia.gov to config/source_allowlist.txt to eliminate the recurring allowlist warning for this authoritative source.",
    "overall_assessment": "APPROVE. This is a clean, well-reported News article based on a primary government source. The rewrite successfully addressed the single required correction. All automated checks pass. The article is ready for publication."
