    "summary": "Five French unions led a three-day walkout at Ubisoft after the publisher cancelled six games, closed two studios, and imposed a five-day office mandate as part of a 200 million euro restructuring.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nMore than 1,200 Ubisoft employees across France and Italy walked off the job from February 10 to 12 in a three-day international strike, the largest labor action in the gaming publisher's history, according to [PocketGamer.biz](https://www.pocketgamer.biz/ubisoft-restructuring-sparks-international-strike-as-1200-staff-walk-out/). The walkout, organized by five French unions — STJV, Solidaires Informatique, CGT, CFE-CGC, and Printemps Ecologique — was triggered by a sweeping restruct...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured News article at 667 words (within 400-1200 News range). Clear sections covering the strike overview, restructuring details, worker grievances, financial context, management response, and unknowns. The Creative Houses reorganization list is well-formatted and adds concrete detail. Good balance between labor, corporate, and financial dimensions of the story.",
    "source_verification": "All 4 sources verified as real and accessible. Game Developer confirmed: five French unions, restructuring announcement, 200M euro cost-cutting plan, 5-day RTO mandate, worker criticism about learning restructuring simultaneously with press, unions demanding accountability. PocketGamer.biz confirmed: 1,200+ strikers Feb 10-12, up to 200 voluntary departures at Paris HQ, September 2024 three-day strike by 700 employees, 17,000 global headcount. Sortiraparis confirmed: Jan 21 announcement, 6 cancellations, 7 delays, Halifax and Stockholm closures, Prince of Persia remake cancellation, 3,000+ jobs cut since 2023, five Creative Houses with franchise assignments, Guillemot 'two core pillars' quote (exact match), 650M euro losses, 1B euro deficit, share price drop to 4.56 euros, market cap to 606M euros, Tencent 1.16B euros and 25%+ of Vantage Studios. Nintendo Life confirmed: 538 vs 1,200+ striker counts, Rutschlé quote (exact match), understaffing and no salary increases, Ubisoft 'open and constructive dialogue' statement.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Core claims verified across all sources. Three attribution concerns identified: (1) The article describes the strike as 'the largest labor action in the gaming publisher's history' and attributes it to PocketGamer.biz — however, PocketGamer does not use this superlative. The claim appears to be an inference from the fact that 1,200 strikers exceeds the 700 from September 2024, but no source explicitly calls it the largest. (2) 'Ubisoft employs roughly 17,000 people globally' is placed in a paragraph citing Nintendo Life, but the 17,000 figure was found in PocketGamer.biz, not Nintendo Life. (3) The article states unions are 'calling for CEO Guillemot's resignation' per Game Developer, but the extracted Game Developer content shows unions calling for general 'accountability' and criticizing 'management' without explicitly demanding resignation. The demand for 'transparent workforce planning' attributed to Game Developer was also not explicitly confirmed in the extracted content — the source discusses opposition to unilateral decisions but doesn't use that specific phrasing. None of these materially change the article's narrative.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. Both sides are represented — union grievances and Ubisoft's official response are presented factually. Financial data is reported without editorializing. The Rutschlé quote is strong criticism but is properly attributed as a direct quote rather than adopted by the article.",
    "originality": "No duplicate or overlapping articles found. No existing articles covering Ubisoft, gaming industry labor, strikes, or game industry restructuring. First gaming industry article in the archive. Fills a clear coverage gap.",
    "concerns": [
      "'Largest labor action in Ubisoft history' is not stated by PocketGamer.biz or any cited source — appears to be an editorial inference",
      "17,000 global employee figure attributed to Nintendo Life but actually found in PocketGamer.biz — misattribution",
      "CEO resignation demand attributed to Game Developer not explicitly confirmed in extracted content — source shows general accountability demands",
      "'Transparent workforce planning' demand not confirmed as specific phrasing in Game Developer source"
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "Consider adding gamedeveloper.com to the source allowlist — it is the leading industry publication for game development professionals",
      "Consider adding pocketgamer.biz and nintendolife.com — both are established gaming outlets with professional editorial standards"
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "Solid News submission covering a significant gaming industry labor action with good structural balance across labor, corporate strategy, and financial dimensions. The four sources are all legitimate gaming/news outlets providing complementary coverage. The main concerns are minor attribution issues: the 'largest labor action' claim lacks source backing, the 17,000 employee figure is attributed to the wrong source, and the CEO resignation demand is not explicitly confirmed in the cited source. These are attribution precision issues rather than factual errors — the underlying facts (1,200 > 700 previous strike, 17,000 employees, unions demanding accountability) are all verified. Approved for publication."
