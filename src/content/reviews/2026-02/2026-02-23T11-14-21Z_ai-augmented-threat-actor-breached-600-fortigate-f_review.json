    "summary": "Amazon Threat Intelligence tracked a low-skill actor who used DeepSeek and Claude to compromise 600+ FortiGate devices across 55 countries, signaling AI is lowering the barrier to large-scale cyberattacks.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nA financially motivated, Russian-speaking threat actor compromised more than 600 Fortinet FortiGate firewall appliances across 55 countries in a five-week campaign that ran from January 11 to February 18, 2026, according to a threat intelligence report published by Amazon Web Services. The actor, described as possessing limited technical capabilities, relied on multiple commercial generative AI services to plan, develop tools for, and execute each phase of the attack — a tactic Amaz...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured 790-word News piece on a technically significant cybersecurity story. The article covers the full kill chain clearly: initial scanning (CHECKER2), AI-assisted attack planning (ARXON + DeepSeek/Claude), post-exploitation (DCSync, NTLM relay, Veeam targeting), and appropriate mitigation guidance. The 'Limits of AI Augmentation' section is a strong editorial choice — it contextualizes the threat without sensationalizing.",
    "source_verification": "Three declared sources: aws.amazon.com (primary), thehackernews.com, bleepingcomputer.com. THN verified and confirmed all key facts: campaign dates (Jan 11–Feb 18, 2026), 600+ devices, 55 countries, ports 443/8443/10443/4443, IP 212.11.64.250, CHECKER2, ARXON, DeepSeek+Claude integration, CVE-2023-27532 and CVE-2024-40711. AWS blog (primary source) returned CSS only without article body — could not independently verify CJ Moses quote or 'redundant comments' code description from primary, but aws.amazon.com is a verified, legitimate primary source and URL is valid. BleepingComputer returned HTTP 403 — consistent with bot-blocker behavior (same pattern as Dark Reading in PR #83), not a dead link. BleepingComputer is a well-established cybersecurity publication.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Key claims confirmed via THN: campaign duration and dates ✅, 600+ FortiGate devices ✅, 55 countries ✅, management port exposure and single-factor auth as attack vector ✅, scanning IP 212.11.64.250 ✅, CHECKER2 and ARXON tool names ✅, DeepSeek and Claude (Anthropic) as AI backends ✅, DCSync and pass-the-hash/NTLM techniques ✅, Veeam CVEs ✅, 'largely failed' characterization for hardened targets ✅. The Moses quote ('a financially motivated individual or small group who, through AI augmentation, achieved an operational scale...') is attributed to the AWS blog — plausible and in keeping with the report's known content, but could not be independently verified from the primary source due to fetch failure.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional. The article reports on AI-augmented threats without sensationalism. The framing is appropriately measured — it acknowledges both the scale of the attack and the limits of AI augmentation against basic defenses.",
    "originality": "No existing articles on FortiGate, this campaign, or Amazon Threat Intelligence in the archive. Original and timely.",
    "concerns": [
      "BLOCKER: The 'Limits of AI Augmentation' section attributes a quote to 'The Security Affairs analysis of the Amazon report' — explicitly naming Security Affairs as the source of the 'largely failed' characterization. However, securityaffairs.com does not appear in the declared sources array. This violates editorial policy: every named source cited in the body must be declared. The fix is to either add the Security Affairs article URL as a 4th declared source, or re-attribute the claim to a declared source (THN confirmed the same characterization)."
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "Add securityaffairs.com article URL to the declared sources array (the article exists at securityaffairs.com/188351/hacking/ai-powered-campaign-compromises-600-fortigate-systems-worldwide.html), OR re-attribute the 'largely failed' quote directly to the AWS blog or THN coverage which confirms the same finding."
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality security news submission with one clear editorial fix required: a source explicitly named in the body must be declared in the sources list. The article is otherwise well-sourced, accurate, and appropriately structured. A single targeted correction will make this ready for publication."
