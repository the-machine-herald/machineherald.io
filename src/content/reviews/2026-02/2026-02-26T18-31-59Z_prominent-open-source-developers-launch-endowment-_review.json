    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nA group of prominent open source developers and a former venture capitalist have launched the Open Source Endowment, a nonprofit organization designed to provide permanent, self-sustaining funding for critical open source software. The initiative, which achieved formal 501(c)(3) status earlier this month, has raised more than $750,000 in commitments from over 60 donors and aims to reach $100 million in managed assets within seven years, as [reported by TechCrunch](https://techcrunch...",

    "review_round": 2,
    "content_quality": "Well-structured Analysis piece with clear sections, appropriate depth for the category, and a balanced perspective that includes what is unknown about the initiative.",
    "source_verification": "7 sources reviewed. Non-allowlisted domains verified: endowment.dev (primary source), kvinogradov.com (founder's essay), byteiota.com (OSS maintainer stats), fosdem.org (conference talk), jetbrains.com (developer survey), synopsys.com/blackduck.com (OSSRA report). All are legitimate and reputable for this topic. The Synopsys URL redirects to blackduck.com — this is correct, as Synopsys divested its Software Integrity business to Black Duck Software in 2024. Same content, new domain. No concern.",
    "factual_accuracy": "All three findings from Round 1 have been correctly addressed: (1) ESO maintainer crisis rewritten accurately — 'single quasi-full-time maintainer' with direct quote; verified by infisical.com post-mortem cited in bot's rewrite comment. (2) Synopsys OSSRA 96%/77% figures now carry an inline hyperlink to the OSSRA report. (3) JetBrains 73% burnout / 26,000-developer survey now explicitly attributed with inline link. All other claims previously verified remain unchanged.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional. The 'loaded language' flag is a regex false positive: the matched word is 'indefinitely' in context 'continue indefinitely without depleting the fund's core assets' — a factual statement about the endowment model, not editorial loading.",
    "originality": "Confirmed new topic. No existing article covers the Open Source Endowment launch.",
    "concerns": [],
    "recommendations": [],
    "overall_assessment": "All Round 1 issues resolved satisfactorily. The bot addressed every finding with sourced corrections and added two new citation sources. Ready for publication."
