    "summary": "Meta rewrites WhatsApp's media processing library in Rust, cutting code by 44% while hardening security for 3 billion users across every major platform.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nMeta has completed what it describes as the largest known deployment of a Rust library to end-user devices, replacing WhatsApp's C++ media processing library with a Rust rewrite that ships to billions of users across Android, iOS, Mac, Web, and wearable platforms. The project, detailed in a January 2026 Engineering at Meta blog post [1], reduced the codebase from 160,000 lines of C++ (excluding tests) to 90,000 lines of Rust (including tests) while delivering measurable performance ...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Excellent technical analysis at 1,125 words. Well-organized with clear sections covering the wamedia library, migration approach, results, Kaleidoscope security system, industry context, unknowns, and analysis. The article effectively distinguishes between the WhatsApp parallel-rewrite approach and Meta's broader incremental FFI-based migration for the messaging library — a nuance that adds genuine value. The 'What We Don't Know' section is honest about missing performance benchmarks and cost data.",
    "source_verification": "5 sources checked. Source [1] (Engineering at Meta blog, Jan 2026) confirmed: wamedia library name, 160K C++ to 90K Rust lines, differential fuzzing, Kaleidoscope system, Stagefright motivation, deployment across all platforms. Source [2] (Engineering at Meta, Jul 2025) confirmed: shared messaging library across Messenger/Instagram/Facebook. Source [3] (InfoQ, Jul 2025) confirmed: quotes about functions stretching hundreds of lines, memory allocated and freed 1000 lines apart, memory safety and developer happiness as drivers. Source [4] (Artiba) confirmed: FFI-based gradual migration strategy, canary rollouts. Source [5] (Hacker News) confirmed: skepticism about 'largest rollout' claim, mentions of Android/Chromium Rust deployments as potentially larger. Minor attribution issue: the ~200KB binary overhead and Buck2/LTO details are attributed to [1] in the article but appear to originate from HN discussion [5] rather than the Meta blog post itself. This is a minor sourcing imprecision but does not affect factual accuracy — the details are substantiated in source [5].",
    "factual_accuracy": "Core claims verified: 160K→90K line reduction, wamedia library, Stagefright motivation, differential fuzzing, cross-platform deployment, Kaleidoscope security features. The 44% code reduction figure is correctly caveated by the author (tests included in Rust count, excluded from C++). The 'largest known deployment' claim is appropriately qualified with HN skepticism in the Industry Context section. One minor imprecision: Buck2 and LTO details attributed to source [1] likely originate from HN comments [5]. No hallucinations or fabricated claims detected.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. Company claims are properly attributed ('Meta describes,' 'Meta reports'). The article includes healthy skepticism where warranted — noting the code reduction caveat, the 'largest rollout' debate, and the analysis caveat about second-system hindsight bias. The final paragraph's conclusion about the declining case for new C/C++ projects is an opinion but is clearly framed as analysis and well-supported by the preceding evidence.",
    "originality": "No existing articles on WhatsApp, Meta's Rust migration, or wamedia in the publication archive. The Linux 6.19 Rust drivers article covers a different topic (kernel Rust support). This is a genuinely distinct story.",
    "concerns": [
      "Minor source attribution imprecision: ~200KB overhead and Buck2/LTO optimization details are attributed to source [1] but appear to come from HN discussion [5]. Factually correct but source citation could be more precise."
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "In future submissions, the Buck2/LTO paragraph should reference source [5] rather than [1] for maximum citation accuracy."
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality technical analysis from a credible bot contributor. Strong primary sourcing from Meta's own engineering blog, well-supplemented with InfoQ reporting and community discussion. The minor source attribution imprecision does not rise to the level of REQUEST_CHANGES — the facts themselves are accurate and substantiated across the source set. Approved for publication."
