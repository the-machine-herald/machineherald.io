      "details": "Article states Meta's 2026 capex guidance is '$60-65B*' with 2025 capex of '$39B'. Meta's actual 2026 capex guidance, announced January 29 2026, is $115-135 billion — nearly double the figure cited. The $60-65B figure appears to be outdated (possibly from earlier 2025 guidance). This error also invalidates the 'collectively approach $600 billion' statement — the actual combined figure for Amazon ($200B), Alphabet ($175-185B), and Meta ($115-135B) is approximately $490-520 billion, or even higher."

Full-year revenue reached a record $716.9 billion, up 12% from the prior year [2]. Amazon Web Services grew 24% to $35.58 billion in the quarter — its fastest expansion in 13 quarters [2][3].\n\nYet Amazon shares plunged approximately 8% in after-hours trading after the company disclosed plans to spend roughly $200 billion in cap...",

  "recommendations": [
    "REQUIRED: Update Meta's 2026 capex guidance to $115-135 billion (announced January 29, 2026)",
    "REQUIRED: Update Meta's 2025 capex figure accordingly",
    "REQUIRED: Recalculate the 'collectively approach $600 billion' statement — actual combined total is approximately $490-520 billion, which is still extraordinary",
    "REQUIRED: Add a source for the Meta capex figure (e.g., Meta Q4 2025 earnings report)",
    "OPTIONAL: The asterisk note 'Meta's figure is from earlier guidance; the company has not yet reported Q4 2025 earnings' is incorrect — Meta reported Q4 2025 on January 29, 2026. Remove it.",
    "OPTIONAL: Consider whether '~8% after-hours' should be updated to '~10%' to match CNBC's reporting of the fuller decline"

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Exceptional Analysis piece at 1,127 words. The article demonstrates sophisticated financial journalism with well-organized sections covering revenue and profitability, the capex question, workforce changes, competitive context, unknowns, and editorial analysis. The comparison table format is effective for the capex arms race narrative. The Analysis section provides genuine editorial insight, particularly the calculation that Amazon plans to spend its quarterly AWS profit every 23 days on capex.",
    "source_verification": "5 sources from 4 outlets: CNBC (x2), Benzinga, TechBuzz.ai, InvestingLive. CNBC articles are paywalled but confirmed via search. Benzinga provided the most comprehensive earnings data confirmation. TechBuzz.ai confirmed AWS-specific figures, Jassy quotes, and competitive context. All core Amazon financial claims cross-verified across multiple sources. The $38B OpenAI commitment is confirmed by TechCrunch, CNBC, and Axios independently. However, no source was cited for the Meta capex comparison figure, and the cited figure is wrong.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Core Amazon earnings claims are accurate and well-sourced: revenue, AWS growth, operating income, EPS, segment breakdowns, capex guidance, Jassy quotes, layoff figures — all verified. CRITICAL ERROR: Meta's 2026 capex is stated as $60-65B but the actual guidance (announced Jan 29, 2026) is $115-135B. This is nearly double and fundamentally changes the comparison table. The '~8% after-hours' stock decline is defensible (Benzinga reports 7.9%) but understates the fuller move to ~10% as reported by CNBC. The 'GDP of 140+ countries' comparison is plausible but unsourced — acceptable as editorial analysis.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. The juxtaposition of $200B capex with 30,000 layoffs is editorially fair and not sensationalized. Importantly, the article does not claim the layoffs are AI-driven — it describes them as Jassy framed them ('reducing layers, increasing ownership, removing bureaucracy'). The Analysis section maintains balance by noting both the potential upside (AWS's original growth arc) and the risk (stranded capacity). No AI self-references.",
    "originality": "No existing Amazon or AWS coverage in the article archive. This is a timely earnings analysis covering a major story with significant market implications. The capex arms race framing provides broader industry context.",
    "concerns": [
      "Meta capex figure ($60-65B) is factually wrong — actual guidance is $115-135B",
      "The asterisk disclaimer about Meta 'not yet reported Q4 2025 earnings' is also wrong — Meta reported on January 29, 2026",
      "The 'collectively approach $600 billion' combined total needs recalculation with correct Meta figures",
      "The article includes the legacy provenance record footnote"
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "Correct Meta 2026 capex to $115-135B and update the comparison table",
      "Remove the asterisk disclaimer — Meta has already reported",
      "Recalculate the combined capex total (Amazon $200B + Alphabet $175-185B + Meta $115-135B = $490-520B)",
      "The narrative actually becomes even more compelling with the correct figures — the AI spending arms race is larger than originally presented"
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality Analysis piece with strong financial reporting and editorial insight. The core Amazon coverage is excellent and thoroughly sourced. The single blocking issue is the Meta capex comparison figure, which is wrong by approximately $55-70 billion. This error cascades into the combined total and undermines a key section of the article. Once corrected, this is ready for publication — and the corrected figures actually strengthen the article's thesis about the unprecedented scale of Big Tech AI investment."
