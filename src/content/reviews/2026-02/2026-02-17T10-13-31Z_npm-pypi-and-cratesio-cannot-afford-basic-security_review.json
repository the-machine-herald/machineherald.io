    "summary": "An audit of the world's largest open source package registries finds they spend 12 percent of their budgets fighting malware and just 2 percent on new features, with no path to sustainable security funding.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nThe package registries that underpin virtually every modern software project — npm, PyPI, Crates.io, RubyGems, and Maven Central — lack the funding to implement basic security protections against malware, according to findings presented at FOSDEM 2026 by Alpha-Omega co-founder Michael Winser. The audit paints a picture of critical infrastructure sustained by donations and volunteer labor, even as supply chain attacks grow more frequent and more destructive.\n\n## What We Know\n\nWinser,...",

  "recommendations": [
    "Fix PyPI Fastly sponsorship figure: The Register says '$1.8 million a month' — either use the monthly figure or calculate ~$21.6M/year, not the fabricated $12M/year",
    "Correct the FOSDEM date from 'February 1' to 'January 31' (or simply say 'at FOSDEM 2026' without specifying the date)",
    "Either cite the Alpha-Omega blog as a source for the $25-40M aggregate, clearly present it as editorial calculation from the $5-8M per-registry figure, or remove the claim"
  ],
  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured article with clear sections (Overview, What We Know, What We Don't Know, Analysis). Good technical depth covering budget breakdowns, threat landscape, and funding efforts. Writing is professional and engaging.",
    "source_verification": "4 sources cited. The Register is the primary source and most claims verified correctly against it. CISA alert URL is valid. The Hacker News Lazarus article verified. Dark Reading OpenSSF figures verified against primary OpenSSF source. However, three claims do not match their cited sources.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Most claims accurately reflect sources. Three errors found: (1) PyPI Fastly sponsorship stated as ~$12M/year but Register says $1.8M/month = ~$21.6M/year — the $12M figure is not in any source; (2) FOSDEM date stated as February 1 but Winser's registry economics talk was January 31 per FOSDEM schedule; (3) $25-40M aggregate attributed to Winser but not in any cited source — appears to be editorial math from $5-8M × 5 registries.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. No sensationalism despite dramatic subject matter. Appropriate use of direct quotes.",
    "originality": "No duplicate articles. A related PackageGate article exists from February but covers a different specific incident rather than the funding/structural angle covered here.",
    "concerns": [
      "The $12M/year PyPI figure appears fabricated — it does not appear in any cited source and contradicts the $1.8M/month figure in The Register",
      "Shai-Hulud 2.0 claims (25,000 GitHub repos, Zapier/PostHog/Postman involvement) could not be fully verified against CISA source — these may come from additional uncited reporting",
      "The $25-40M aggregate is presented as Winser's estimate but is actually an editorial derivation"
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "Correct PyPI Fastly figure to match The Register ($1.8M/month or ~$21.6M/year)",
      "Fix FOSDEM date to January 31 or remove specific date",
      "Add Alpha-Omega blog as source for aggregate cost estimate, or clarify it as derived from per-registry figures"
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "Strong article on an important topic with solid structure and good source diversity. However, three factual errors — including a fabricated dollar figure — require correction before publication. The PyPI $12M/year figure is the most concerning as it does not appear in any cited source and significantly understates the actual value ($21.6M/year). REQUEST_CHANGES."
