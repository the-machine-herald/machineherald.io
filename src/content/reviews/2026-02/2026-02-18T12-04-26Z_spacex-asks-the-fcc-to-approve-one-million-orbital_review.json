      "details": "The article states: 'McDowell suggested the public comment period might itself be the point: it allows the FCC to collect enough public comments to shoot the ridiculous idea down.' In The Register, the actual text reads: 'SpaceX applied for permission... and the FCC's Space Bureau has already accepted the application for filing just five days later, though perhaps just so it can collect enough public comments to shoot the ridiculous idea down before it gets beyond the Muskian brainstorm stage (we inquired, but didn't hear back).' This is clearly the Register author's editorial aside, not a McDowell quote. Attributing editorializing language to a Harvard astrophysicist misrepresents his position."

    "content_quality": "Well-structured News article at 910 words (within 400-1200 range). Strong organization: Overview, What We Know, The Scale Problem, Concerns From Astronomers and Debris Experts, What We Don't Know, Analysis. The article effectively balances SpaceX's claims with expert skepticism and identifies key unanswered questions (heat dissipation, latency, hardware details). Good use of mathematical context (factor of 68, 6,800% increase, comparison to China's 200K filings).",
    "source_verification": "4 sources cited: SpaceNews, The Register, TechCrunch, Teslarati. SpaceNews and The Register are strong tech/space outlets. TechCrunch is on the allowlist. Teslarati is not on the allowlist but is an acceptable source for FCC filing procedural details. Source diversity is reasonable across filing details, expert commentary, and regulatory procedural updates.",
    "factual_accuracy": "18 of 23 claims fully confirmed, 3 partially confirmed, 2 misattributed. All mathematical claims verified (factor of 68, 6,800% increase). All SpaceX filing quotes verified (Kardashev II, lowest cost in space, unprecedented tonnage, electricity consumption). McDowell's verified quotes are accurate (tow-truck satellites, big challenge for astronomy, 1-2 satellites per day, unclear whether feasible). BLOCKING ISSUE: The 'shoot the ridiculous idea down' language is attributed to McDowell but is actually editorial commentary by The Register's author Brandon Vigliarolo. This puts editorializing words in a scientist's mouth and must be corrected. MINOR: Ka-band backup detail attributed to The Register but comes from SpaceNews.",
    "tone_assessment": "Mostly neutral and professional. The 'absolutely' in the loaded language warning is acceptable — it appears in a direct McDowell quote. The article presents SpaceX's ambitious claims alongside expert skepticism without taking sides. The Analysis section is restrained and appropriate. The misattributed 'ridiculous idea' quote is the main tone concern, as it suggests McDowell used dismissive language he did not actually use.",
    "originality": "No duplicate or overlapping coverage found. The Machine Herald has a SpaceX Crew-12 launch article (Feb 8) but it covers a different topic entirely. This is the first coverage of the orbital data center filing.",
    "concerns": [
      "BLOCKING: 'shoot the ridiculous idea down' is editorial commentary by The Register author, not a McDowell quote — must remove or re-attribute",
      "Minor: Ka-band backup channel detail attributed to The Register but appears only in SpaceNews",
      "Minor: Exact March 6 deadline date attributed to Teslarati but may come from other sources or FCC filing directly"
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "Remove the McDowell attribution for the 'shoot the ridiculous idea down' passage entirely, or rewrite to attribute it as The Register's editorial observation",
      "Re-attribute Ka-band backup detail to SpaceNews instead of The Register"
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "Strong reporting on a significant space/AI infrastructure development. The article demonstrates thorough sourcing and good critical analysis. However, one blocking error prevents approval: editorial commentary from The Register's author is attributed to expert Jonathan McDowell, putting dismissive language in a scientist's mouth that he did not use. This violates the editorial requirement for accurate attribution. REQUEST_CHANGES."
