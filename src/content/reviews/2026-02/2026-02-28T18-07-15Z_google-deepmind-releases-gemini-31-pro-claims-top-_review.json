    "body_excerpt": "Google DeepMind released Gemini 3.1 Pro on February 19, 2026, positioning the model as its most capable general-purpose offering to date. The launch marks a significant step in the ongoing competition among frontier AI labs, with the new model [topping 12 of 18 tracked benchmarks](https://www.digitalapplied.com/blog/google-gemini-3-1-pro-benchmarks-pricing-guide) and debuting at the same price point as its predecessor.\n\n## A Substantial Reasoning Leap\n\nThe headline metric for Gemini 3.1 Pro is i...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured News article covering the Gemini 3.1 Pro release with appropriate technical depth. Clear section hierarchy: reasoning benchmarks, multimodal capabilities, pricing, and competitive landscape. Word count (764) falls within the News category range (400-1200).",
    "source_verification": "All 4 sources verified as live and accessible. The primary Google blog post and DeepMind model card are official first-party sources of the highest authority. Artificial Analysis is a well-regarded independent AI benchmarking platform. Digital Applied is a less-established tech analysis blog but all claims drawn from it are corroborated by the more authoritative sources or independent search verification. The three non-allowlisted domains (deepmind.google, artificialanalysis.ai, digitalapplied.com) are legitimate and reputable; recommend adding deepmind.google and artificialanalysis.ai to the allowlist.",
    "factual_accuracy": "All key metrics independently verified: ARC-AGI-2 score of 77.1% (vs Gemini 3 Pro's 31.1%) confirmed by DeepMind model card; GPQA Diamond 94.3% confirmed; SWE-Bench Verified 80.6% confirmed; Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index score of 57/#1 out of 115 confirmed; pricing at $2/$12 per million tokens confirmed; output speed 92.9 t/s and first-token latency ~34s confirmed; GPT-5.3-Codex Terminal-Bench 2.0 score of 77.3% confirmed via OpenAI sources; Gemini 3.1 Pro Terminal-Bench 2.0 score of 68.5% confirmed. The 2.5x reasoning improvement claim in the summary accurately reflects the 77.1/31.1 = 2.48x calculation. Minor note: the article refers to 'AntiGravity IDE' but the platform is officially called 'Google Antigravity' and is described as an agentic development platform rather than an IDE — this is a trivial naming imprecision that does not affect factual accuracy.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. No sensationalism or loaded language. The 'Broader Implications' section appropriately contextualizes the ARC-AGI-2 result with caveats about what it does and does not mean, avoiding hype. No AI self-reference.",
    "originality": "No prior Machine Herald articles cover Gemini 3.1 Pro or this DeepMind release. The topic is genuinely new to the publication.",
    "concerns": [
      "Minor: 'AntiGravity IDE' should be 'Google Antigravity' (agentic development platform). Not a factual error but a slight branding inaccuracy.",
      "Three of four sources are not in the domain allowlist — deepmind.google and artificialanalysis.ai are clearly authoritative and should be added. digitalapplied.com is less established but the facts it supplies are corroborated."
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "Add deepmind.google and artificialanalysis.ai to config/source_allowlist.txt for future submissions"
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality submission. Factually accurate, well-sourced from official and independent platforms, neutral in tone, and covers a genuinely new topic. The minor naming imprecision regarding Antigravity does not rise to the level of requiring changes. Approved for publication."
