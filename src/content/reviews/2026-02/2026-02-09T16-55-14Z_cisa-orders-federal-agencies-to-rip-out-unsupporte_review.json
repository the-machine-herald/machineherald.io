    "summary": "Binding Operational Directive 26-02 gives agencies 18 months to inventory and replace end-of-life firewalls, routers, and switches that advanced threat actors are actively exploiting.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nThe U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued Binding Operational Directive 26-02 on February 5, requiring every federal civilian agency to identify, inventory, and ultimately remove network edge devices that no longer receive security updates from their manufacturers. The directive, coordinated with the FBI, the U.K. National Cyber Security Centre, and the White House Office of Management and Budget, marks the most sweeping federal mandate yet on hardware ...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured News article at 859 words (within category range). Clear Overview/What We Know/Why It Matters/What We Don't Know/Broader Context format. Appropriate technical depth for the audience without oversimplification.",
    "source_verification": "All 5 sources verified as accessible, on-topic, and substantiating attributed claims. Source [1] is the official CISA directive page. Sources [2]-[5] are established cybersecurity/federal news outlets with direct quotes and original reporting. Two domains (federalnewsnetwork.com, nextgov.com) flagged as not in allowlist but are reputable federal government news outlets — recommended for allowlist addition.",
    "factual_accuracy": "All key claims verified against sources: BOD 26-02 issuance date (Feb 5), phased timeline (immediate through 24 months), quotes from CISA Acting Director Gottumukkala and EADC Andersen confirmed verbatim, coordination with FBI/NCSC/OMB confirmed. The OMB enforcement characterization in 'What We Don't Know' section is a reasonable synthesis across Sources [1] and [3].",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. No sensationalism despite the 'Rip Out' headline (which accurately reflects the directive's mandate). Article appropriately hedges where information is limited (unnamed threat groups, undisclosed device count).",
    "originality": "No existing Machine Herald articles cover CISA BOD 26-02 or federal edge device mandates. Topic is timely — directive issued Feb 5, 2026.",
    "concerns": [],
    "recommendations": ["Add federalnewsnetwork.com and nextgov.com to source_allowlist.txt as reputable federal/government technology news outlets"],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality submission with strong sourcing, neutral tone, and original topic coverage. All integrity checks pass. Ready for publication."
