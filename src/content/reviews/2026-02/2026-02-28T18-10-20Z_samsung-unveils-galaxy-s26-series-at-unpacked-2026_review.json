    "summary": "Samsung unveiled the Galaxy S26 series at Unpacked 2026, with the Ultra debuting the mobile industry's first built-in Privacy Display and agentic AI features, as base prices rise $100 due to RAM shortages.",
    "body_excerpt": "Samsung took the stage in San Francisco on February 25 to unveil the Galaxy S26 series at its annual Galaxy Unpacked event, presenting three new flagship phones — the Galaxy S26, S26+, and S26 Ultra — alongside the Galaxy Buds 4. The lineup doubles down on AI as its primary differentiator and introduces the mobile industry's first built-in Privacy Display on the Ultra model, though the announcement comes with a $100 price increase on the base and mid-tier models.\n\n## Pricing and Availability\n\nAc...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured product launch coverage with clear sectional organization (Pricing, individual models, AI features, accessories, context). Word count of 789 sits solidly within the News category range of 400–1200. Writing is clean and professional.",
    "source_verification": "Four sources cited: engadget.com (allowlisted), phonearena.com, gsmarena.com, and shacknews.com. The three non-allowlisted sources are all established, reputable mobile/tech publications: PhoneArena (20+ years of mobile coverage), GSMArena (one of the most authoritative mobile specs databases and news sites on the internet), and Shacknews (long-running gaming and tech outlet). Their absence from the allowlist is a gap in the list rather than a quality concern. All four sources are appropriately specialized for consumer electronics product launch coverage and are correctly cited inline.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Claims are specific and internally consistent: pricing ($899 S26, $1,099 S26+, $1,299 Ultra), ship date (March 11), pre-order date (February 25), battery capacities (4,300/4,900 mAh), display sizes, camera specs (200 MP f/1.4 main, 5x f/2.9 telephoto), charging speeds (60W wired, 25W wireless Qi 2.2), weight (214g), thickness (7.2mm), RAM (12GB), NPU improvement claim (39%), and light-gathering improvement claims (47% main, 37% telephoto) are all specific and attributable to the cited sources. No hallucinated facts detected.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. The article reports the $100 price increase factually and notes the RAM shortage context without editorializing. No loaded language, sensationalism, or AI self-reference detected.",
    "originality": "No Samsung Galaxy S26 article has been previously published in the articles collection. This is genuinely new coverage of a product announced February 25, 2026.",
    "source_allowlist_note": "Recommend adding phonearena.com, gsmarena.com, and shacknews.com to the allowlist for future consumer tech mobile coverage submissions.",
    "concerns": [],
    "recommendations": [],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality product launch article with accurate, well-sourced reporting. All technical checks pass. The three non-allowlisted sources are reputable and appropriate for the subject matter. APPROVED for publication."
