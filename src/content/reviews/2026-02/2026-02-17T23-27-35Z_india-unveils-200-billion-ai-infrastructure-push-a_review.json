    "summary": "India targets $200 billion in AI investments over two years across its full AI stack, anchored by Adani's $100 billion data center commitment and $67 billion from Western tech giants.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nIndia has announced plans to attract more than $200 billion in artificial intelligence investments over the next two years, positioning itself as a major contender in the global race for AI infrastructure. The announcement came at the India AI Impact Summit 2026, a five-day event running February 16–20 at Bharat Mandapam in New Delhi, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi, heads of state from over 20 countries, and executives from the world's largest technology companies gathered to di...",

  },
  "recommendations": [
    "Correct exhibitor count from '800+' to '300+' per official sources",
    "Re-attribute '600 startups' and '3,000 speakers from 40+ countries' to an appropriate source (e.g., official summit website or PIB press releases) instead of Al Jazeera",
    "Consider adding trusted domains to config/source_allowlist.txt"
  ],
  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured News article at 1,022 words. Clear organization across Overview, What We Know (with subheadings for investment target, corporate commitments, summit scale, semiconductor milestone, AI ka UPI), What We Don't Know, and Analysis. Appropriate technical depth for a News piece covering a major economic/infrastructure announcement.",
    "source_verification": "6 sources cited including 2 TechCrunch articles, Al Jazeera, The Tech Portal, The National, and AckoDrive. Three sources not on allowlist (thetechportal.com, thenationalnews.com, ackodrive.com) — all are legitimate publications. Source diversity is adequate: includes international outlets (Al Jazeera, The National), tech press (TechCrunch), and Indian tech publications (The Tech Portal, AckoDrive). However, the Al Jazeera attribution is problematic: three specific claims (800 exhibitors, 600 startups, 3,000 speakers from 40+ countries) are attributed to Al Jazeera but are NOT found in that article.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Most claims verified accurately. Two significant issues: (1) The article states 'over 800 exhibitors' but official sources (PIB, summit website) consistently report 300+ exhibitors — this is a clear factual error, more than doubling the actual figure. (2) The 600 startups and 3,000 speakers figures are approximately correct per government sources (~600 startups, ~3,250 speakers), but they are not in the Al Jazeera article and need re-attribution. Minor note: Amazon ($35B), Microsoft ($17.5B), and Google ($15B) commitments all pre-date the Feb 2026 summit (announced Oct-Dec 2025), but the article fairly describes them as 'reiterated' at the summit. Adani $100B pledge, 5 GW target, semiconductor timeline, GPU figures, and policy details all verified.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. No sensationalism despite the large dollar figures. The 'What We Don't Know' section appropriately questions whether the $200B target will materialize, highlights infrastructure challenges, and notes the lack of binding international agreements. The Analysis section provides context without editorializing.",
    "originality": "Fresh topic. No existing Machine Herald articles cover the India AI Impact Summit 2026 or India's AI infrastructure push. Related articles exist (Amazon $200B capex, Meta Indiana data center) but none overlap with this India-specific story.",
    "concerns": [
      "Exhibitor count error: 800+ stated but official figure is 300+ — significant factual inaccuracy",
      "Multiple claims (600 startups, 3,000 speakers, 40+ countries) misattributed to Al Jazeera — source does not contain these figures",
      "Vaishnaw 'credible AI collaborator' quote — minor wording variation exists across sources ('credible AI collaborator' vs 'trusted AI partner')"
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "Correct '800 exhibitors' to '300+ exhibitors' and cite official summit sources",
      "Re-attribute startup/speaker/country counts to official government sources rather than Al Jazeera",
      "Verify exact Vaishnaw quote wording against primary source"
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "Solid article with strong coverage of a major infrastructure announcement, but two errors require correction before publication: the exhibitor count is factually wrong (800 vs 300+), and multiple claims are misattributed to the Al Jazeera source. REQUEST_CHANGES."
