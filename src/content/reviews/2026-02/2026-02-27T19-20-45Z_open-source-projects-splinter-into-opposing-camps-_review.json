    "summary": "A RedMonk study of 32 organizations reveals a fragmented policy landscape as projects from cURL to the Linux kernel draw competing lines on AI code.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nThe open-source ecosystem is fracturing along a new fault line: what to do about code written by artificial intelligence. A [RedMonk analysis](https://redmonk.com/kholterhoff/2026/02/26/generative-ai-policy-landscape-in-open-source/) published on February 26 surveyed 32 open-source organizations and found no consensus emerging. Instead, the community is splintering into at least three distinct camps -- outright bans, cautious conditional acceptance, and permissive frameworks -- each...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "review_round": 2,
    "content_quality": "Well-structured Analysis article with a clear three-camp taxonomy (hard-ban, conditional acceptance, permissive). The writing is neutral, precise, and avoids sensationalism. 1,418 words, within the Analysis 800-2000 range.",
    "source_verification": "All three findings from Round 1 have been addressed. (1) NetBSD citation: now correctly linked to The Register 2024/05/18 article covering NetBSD and Gentoo AI bans — independently verified. (2) Seth Larson citation: confirmed the quote is correctly attributed to the RedMonk Slopageddon article; Mitchell Hashimoto's quote correctly links to InfoQ where he is quoted. (3) FreeBSD language: softened from 'barring' to 'has been moving toward a similarly cautious stance' with explicit temporal context ('As of September 2025, still developing a formal policy') — accurately reflects The Register source which states the policy was not yet finalized.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Key facts verified: cURL bug bounty shutdown, 5% valid submission rate, 20% AI-generated submissions — all confirmed against RedMonk Slopageddon article. Seth Larson quote verified in correct source. Hashimoto 'anti-idiot stance' quote verified in InfoQ. FreeBSD policy status accurately described as in-progress. The Register 2024 source confirms NetBSD commit guideline update restricting LLM-generated code (article uses 'tainted' terminology from NetBSD's own policy language).",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. No AI self-reference. No sensationalism. The Analysis section offers reasoned editorial perspective appropriately without editorializing.",
    "originality": "Distinct from the Feb 22 article ('AI-Generated Slop Is Overwhelming Open Source Projects'). The prior article covers the crisis phenomenon and emergency countermeasures; this submission is anchored to the Feb 26 RedMonk policy landscape study and focuses on the formal governance taxonomy across 32 organizations — a different angle with new primary source material published after the prior article.",
    "concerns": [],
    "recommendations": [],
    "overall_assessment": "All Round 1 findings satisfactorily addressed. The bot correctly disputed Finding 2 (Seth Larson citation was already correct in original) and made appropriate corrections for Findings 1 and 3. High-quality submission ready for publication."
