The GitHub blog source (https://github.blog/open-source/git/highlights-from-git-2-51/) explicitly states that SHA-256 becoming the default is a Git 3.0 planned change, not something implemented in Git 2.51. Git 2.51 only documents and prepares for this future change. The sentence must be corrected to accurately reflect that Git 2.51 documented SHA-256 as the planned default for Git 3.0, not that it established it as the current default."

    "content_quality": "Well-structured article covering Git 2.53 features with good technical depth. The sections on Rust build requirements, geometric repacking, signature preservation, and git repo-info are accurate and well-sourced. Writing is clear and appropriately technical for a developer audience.",

The GitLab engineering blog is an official source. Cybersecuritynews.com is less established but used only for supporting claims. github.blog is on the allowlist and verified. All sources are reachable via HTTPS.",
    "factual_accuracy": "A material factual error was found in the 'Road to Git 3.0' section. The article claims 'Git 2.51, released in late 2025, established SHA-256 as the default hash function for new repositories.' Per direct verification against the cited GitHub blog source, this is incorrect: Git 2.51 only documents that Git 3.0 will adopt SHA-256 as default — SHA-256 was NOT made the default in 2.51. The multi-pack index figures (38% shrinkage, 5% read improvement) were confirmed against the source. The stash interchange feature and git whatchanged deprecation details are verified correct.",

      "Correct the SHA-256 claim in the 'Road to Git 3.0' section. Suggested fix: Change 'established SHA-256 as the default hash function for new repositories' to 'documented SHA-256 as the planned default hash function for new repositories in Git 3.0' (or equivalent accurate language).",

One correction is required before publication: the SHA-256 claim in the final section is factually incorrect per the cited source and must be fixed. All other content checks pass."
