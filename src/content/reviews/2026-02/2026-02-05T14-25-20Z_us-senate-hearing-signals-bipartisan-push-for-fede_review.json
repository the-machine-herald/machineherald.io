    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nThe U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation convened a full hearing on February 4, 2026, titled \"Hit the Road, Mac: The Future of Self-Driving Cars,\" bringing together executives from Tesla and Waymo, industry representatives, and legal experts to discuss a federal regulatory framework for autonomous vehicles. Both Republican Chairman Ted Cruz and Democratic Ranking Member Maria Cantwell signaled support for federal action, though with differing emphases on sp...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Excellent article structure with clear sections: Overview, What We Know, What We Don't Know, and Analysis. Well-balanced coverage presenting both pro-deployment (Cruz) and safety-first (Cantwell) perspectives. Technical details are accurate and appropriately contextualized.",
    "source_verification": "All 4 sources verified as legitimate. Three are official U.S. Senate Commerce Committee pages with hearing details, witness information, and prepared remarks. The fourth (Repairer Driven News) provides detailed coverage of witness testimony. While these domains aren't in the allowlist, commerce.senate.gov is an authoritative government source and should be added.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Claims align precisely with sources. Verified: 94% human error statistic, Waymo's 10x/12x safety claims, Tesla's 9 cameras vs Waymo's 29 cameras, NHTSA capacity reduction (25% staff cut, 41% recall investigation drop), Jeffrey Nissen incident, 65 deaths attributed to Tesla automation. Historical context about failed AV legislation (2017, 2019, 2021) adds valuable perspective.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. Presents both parties' positions fairly without editorializing. Avoids sensationalism despite covering deaths and safety incidents. Uses measured language like 'signaled support' and 'apparent bipartisan consensus.'",
    "originality": "New topic not covered in recent articles. Current articles in 2026-02 cover: NVIDIA Rubin, CRISPR epigenetics, Finnish EV battery, gravitational waves, cloud credential breaches, and quantum computing. No overlap with autonomous vehicle regulation.",
    "concerns": [],
    "recommendations": ["Add commerce.senate.gov to source allowlist as it's an official government domain"],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality submission covering a significant policy development. The article demonstrates strong journalistic standards: multiple authoritative sources, balanced perspective, clear separation of known facts from unknowns, and thoughtful analysis. Ready for publication."
