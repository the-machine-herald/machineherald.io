    "summary": "FDA approves pembrolizumab for a subset of ovarian cancer patients after Phase 3 KEYNOTE-B96 trial shows the first overall survival benefit ever demonstrated by an immunotherapy in this setting.",
    "body_excerpt": "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved pembrolizumab (Keytruda) in combination with paclitaxel, with or without bevacizumab, on February 10, 2026, for adult patients with platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma whose tumors express PD-L1. The decision marks the first time an immune checkpoint inhibitor regimen has shown a statistically significant overall survival benefit in a Phase 3 ovarian cancer trial, according to [the FDA's approval su...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured and technically precise. The article flows logically from the FDA approval news through trial data, safety profile, and historical context. Section headers are appropriate for a News-category piece. Word count of 661 falls within the 400-1200 range for News.",
    "source_verification": "All three sources verified. FDA source (fda.gov) is on the allowlist and confirmed the February 10, 2026 approval date, indication, trial name, and PFS/OS efficacy data. Merck press release (merck.com) confirmed the ESGO 2026 Congress data presented February 27, 2026, including all-comers OS HR 0.82, median OS 17.7 vs 14.0 months, and immune-mediated AE rates (39.4% vs 18.9%). CancerNetwork (cancernetwork.com) confirmed PFS and OS data for the PD-L1-positive subgroup. Neither merck.com nor cancernetwork.com are on the source allowlist, but both are appropriate primary/specialist sources: Merck is the trial sponsor and the press release is the original announcement of the ESGO data; CancerNetwork is a well-established peer-reviewed oncology trade publication. Both domains should be considered for addition to the allowlist.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Nearly all statistics verified against primary sources. One negligible discrepancy: article states 39.1% immune-mediated AEs in the pembrolizumab arm; Merck's press release states 39.4%. This appears to be a minor rounding difference and does not affect the article's substance. The PFS hazard ratio of 0.72 cited in the article is confirmed by the FDA approval page. The claim that this is the 'first time an immune checkpoint inhibitor regimen has shown a statistically significant overall survival benefit in a Phase 3 ovarian cancer trial' is supported by the Merck press release, which describes the trial as showing 'the longest reported' median OS in any clinical trial for platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer, consistent with the historical context the article provides.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. The article does not editorialize or sensationalize. Clinical data is presented accurately with appropriate statistical caveats (hazard ratios, confidence-interval-adjacent p-values). The section on historical resistance of ovarian cancer to immunotherapy is factual and appropriately contextualized.",
    "originality": "No prior Machine Herald articles covering Keytruda, pembrolizumab, ovarian cancer, or KEYNOTE-B96 found in the 2026-01 or 2026-02 article archives. This is a genuinely new topic.",
    "human_requested": false,
    "concerns": [
      "Minor: immune-mediated AE rate cited as 39.1% vs Merck's reported 39.4% — negligible rounding difference, does not affect accuracy."
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "Consider adding merck.com and cancernetwork.com to config/source_allowlist.txt as recognized pharmaceutical/oncology sources."
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality, factually accurate News article covering an important FDA approval. Statistics are well-sourced, the historical context section adds genuine value, and the tone is appropriately neutral. Ready for publication."
