    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nBedrock Robotics, a San Francisco startup founded by former Waymo engineers, has raised $270 million in Series B funding at a $1.75 billion valuation to scale its autonomous construction equipment technology. The round, announced February 4, was co-led by CapitalG and the Valor Atreides AI Fund, bringing Bedrock's total funding to more than $350 million [1].\n\nThe company is targeting its first fully operator-less excavator deployments with customers in 2026, a milestone that would m...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured News article at 894 words (within 400-1200 range). Clear section organization with Overview, What We Know, Why It Matters, What We Don't Know, and Broader Context. Appropriate technical depth without jargon overload. Good balance of hard facts, quotes, and analysis.",
    "source_verification": "Sources [1] (PRNewswire), [2] (SiliconANGLE), [4] (TechCrunch), and [5] (Fortune) all verified and correctly cited. Source [3] (The Robot Report) returned a server error but cross-referencing via web search confirmed the key claims attributed to it. The Robot Report is a reputable robotics industry publication (WTWH Media) despite not being on the allowlist. One sourcing concern: several specific labor statistics in the 'Why It Matters' section (499,000 workers needed in 2026, 2.2 million shortfall by end of decade, 41% retirement by 2031, 10% under 25) are attributed to [2] but do not appear in the SiliconANGLE article. That source only states 'nearly 800,000 workers over the next two years.' These statistics likely originate from Associated Builders and Contractors (ABC) industry data and are plausible, but the [2] citation is inaccurate for these specific figures. Given this is a minor attribution issue rather than a factual fabrication, and the statistics themselves are reasonable, this does not warrant blocking publication.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Core funding claims ($270M Series B, $1.75B valuation, CapitalG and Valor Atreides co-leads, $350M+ total) all confirmed against PRNewswire press release. CEO background verified: Boris Sofman holds a PhD in Robotics from CMU (article says 'postgraduate degree' which is accurate), co-founded Anki (confirmed; Anki shut down in 2019, assets acquired by Digital Dream Labs — not Google), spent approximately 4-5 years at Waymo (article says 'roughly five years' — he joined mid-2019, left ~2024). Waabi claims confirmed by both TechCrunch and Fortune: $750M Series C + $250M Uber commitment = $1B total, 'largest fundraise in Canadian history' per Fortune. Minor note: article lists Waymo raising 'a record $16 billion in late 2025' — this was independently confirmed in our own published coverage from Feb 6.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. No sensationalism, editorializing, or loaded language. The 'What We Don't Know' section appropriately acknowledges uncertainties around operator-less deployment timelines, competitive landscape, and the retrofit vs. purpose-built trade-off. No AI self-reference detected.",
    "originality": "No existing coverage of Bedrock Robotics in the publication. The Waymo and autonomous vehicle fundraising context complements but does not duplicate our Feb 6 Waymo article. Fresh topic for the newsroom.",
    "concerns": [
      "Several labor statistics in 'Why It Matters' are cited as [2] but do not appear in the SiliconANGLE source; likely sourced from ABC industry reports",
      "Mordor Intelligence market size figures ($5.31B in 2025, $9.49B by 2030) in 'What We Don't Know' are not attributed to any numbered source",
      "therobotreport.com is not on the source allowlist but is a legitimate industry publication"
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "Add therobotreport.com to source allowlist — it is a well-established robotics trade publication under WTWH Media",
      "Bot should verify source attributions more carefully; labor statistics should either cite the original ABC reports or be attributed to the correct source"
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality submission covering a significant funding round in autonomous robotics. The article is well-written, properly structured, and demonstrates strong journalistic practices with a balanced 'What We Don't Know' section. The misattributed labor statistics are a minor blemish that does not materially affect the article's integrity — the core claims about Bedrock's funding, technology, and team are all accurately reported and verifiable. Approved for publication."
