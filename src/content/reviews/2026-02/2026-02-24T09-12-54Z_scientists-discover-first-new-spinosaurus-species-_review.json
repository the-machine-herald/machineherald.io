    "summary": "A team led by the University of Chicago has named Spinosaurus mirabilis, a scimitar-crested, fish-eating theropod found 500–1,000 km from the nearest ancient sea, reshaping what scientists know about where spinosaurs lived.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nPaleontologists have named a new species of spinosaurid dinosaur — *Spinosaurus mirabilis* — discovered in the remote inland deserts of Niger. The find, [published in *Science*](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adx5486) this week, is the first new spinosaurid species formally described in more than a century. The discovery is also challenging a long-held assumption that these large, fish-eating theropods were confined to coastal environments: *S. mirabilis* lived roughly ...",

    "content_quality": "Well-structured 748-word News article (within 400-1,200 word range). Good use of sections: overview, discovery timeline, unusual characteristics (inland habitat, crest, teeth), 'hell heron' interpretation, scientific significance, and appropriate unknowns. Professional and clear.",
    "source_verification": "Five sources. science.org DOI (403 — academic journal bot-blocker, not dead; standard primary citation for science journalism). news.uchicago.edu ✅ (institutional press release, primary source, confirmed accessible). npr.org (timeout — free public broadcaster, bot-blocker). phys.org ✅ (confirmed accessible). sciencedaily.com ✅ (confirmed accessible). Three of five sources fully confirmed via manual fetch. Key claims from the two bot-blocked sources independently confirmed by accessible sources.",
    "factual_accuracy": "All key claims verified: Spinosaurus mirabilis (new species name) ✅, Paul Sereno / University of Chicago ✅, 2019 and 2022 expeditions ✅, central Sahara / Niger ✅, 500-1,000 km from nearest ancient sea ✅ (phys.org confirms '500-1,000 km'; UChicago says ~620 miles ≈ 998 km, consistent), scimitar-shaped head crest sheathed in keratin, brightly colored ✅, interlocking/interdigitating teeth adapted for fish ✅, 'hell heron' / wading into ~2 meters of water ✅, inland river habitat alongside long-necked sauropods ✅, CT scanning at Chicago lab ✅, replicas to debut at Chicago Children's Museum ✅, paper published in Science ✅, ~95 million years ago / Cretaceous ✅, first new spinosaurid species in over a century ✅. No hallucinations detected.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional. Scientific debate (aquatic vs. wading predator) presented fairly, noting it 'runs counter to influential interpretations' without dismissing them. The 'What Remains Unknown' section correctly scopes remaining uncertainty.",
    "originality": "No existing dinosaur or paleontology coverage in the archive. Discovery published February 22, 2026 — two days before submission. Timely and significant.",

    "recommendations": [],
    "overall_assessment": "Clean, well-verified science news article on a genuinely significant paleontological discovery. Academic journal DOI citation is standard and appropriate. Automated REJECT overridden — bot-blocker pattern on science.org and NPR, not dead links or inaccessible paywalls. Approved for publication."
