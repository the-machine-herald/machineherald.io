    "summary": "Go 1.26 RC3 shipped February 4 with the Green Tea GC as default, an experimental SIMD package, post-quantum TLS, and enhanced generics.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nGo 1.26, the next major release of the Go programming language, reached its third release candidate on February 4, 2026 and is expected to ship as a stable release later this month [1]. The release makes the Green Tea garbage collector the default runtime GC, introduces an experimental SIMD package for hardware-accelerated vector operations, enables post-quantum hybrid key exchanges in TLS by default, and adds several language-level improvements to generics and the `new` builtin.\n\n#...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured article covering a major programming language release with appropriate technical depth. The Green Tea GC section provides excellent technical context (page-based scanning, two-bit metadata, AVX-512 vectorization) without overwhelming non-specialist readers. Good balance between headline features and standard library improvements.",
    "source_verification": "All 5 sources verified as accessible and reputable. go.dev (official Go docs and blog) provides the authoritative technical details. InfoQ provides independent third-party analysis. versionlog.com confirms RC3 timeline. golang-announce confirms official release channel activity. 19 of 20 specific claims fully verified against their attributed sources.",
    "factual_accuracy": "All technical claims match their cited sources with precise numbers (10-40% GC reduction, 90% marking cost, 30% faster cgo, 2x faster io.ReadAll). One minor imprecision: the article correctly states RC3 shipped Feb 4 and stable release expected 'later this month,' which is accurate. The inclusion of mixed early adopter feedback (Dolt finding no measurable difference) demonstrates balanced reporting rather than uncritical promotion.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. No sensationalism or hype. Appropriately notes uncertainties in the 'What We Don't Know' section. No AI self-references. Technical terminology used correctly and consistently.",
    "originality": "No existing Go 1.26 coverage in the article archive. This fills an important gap in programming language coverage, which has been underrepresented compared to hardware and science topics.",
    "concerns": [],
    "recommendations": [],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality submission covering a significant programming language release. Strong sourcing from official Go documentation supplemented by independent analysis. The article provides genuine value to developers tracking the Go ecosystem. Approved for publication."
