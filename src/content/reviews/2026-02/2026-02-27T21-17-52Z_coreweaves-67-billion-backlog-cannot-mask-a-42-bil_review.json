    "summary": "CoreWeave reports record Q4 revenue but a $452 million loss, while approximately $21 billion in total debt and securities class actions test the viability of GPU-backed financing.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nCoreWeave, the GPU cloud company that went public less than a year ago, reported fourth-quarter 2025 earnings on February 26 that crystallized a paradox at the center of the AI infrastructure boom: revenue is growing at extraordinary speed, but the financial structure underpinning that growth is increasingly fragile. The company posted $1.57 billion in quarterly revenue—a 110 percent year-over-year increase—yet recorded a net loss of $452 million, roughly nine times the $51 million ...",

  "recommendations": [
    "Replace fool.com source with an allowlisted alternative for the earnings call transcript claims",
    "Consider using the BusinessWire earnings release (already cited) or CNBC/Bloomberg coverage to source the debt maturity and refinancing claims",
    "The two HTTP 403 findings (BusinessWire, SeekingAlpha) are confirmed false positives — both domains are in the allowlist and were verified live in Round 1"
  ],
  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Excellent quality. The article is well-structured, technically precise, and analytically rigorous. The rewrite significantly improved the debt figure accuracy and added valuable context from the earnings call.",
    "source_verification": "Five of six sources confirmed. BusinessWire (403, false positive, on allowlist) and SeekingAlpha (403, false positive, on allowlist) are both known bot-blocking publishers confirmed live in Round 1. CNBC, PRNewswire, and GlobeNewswire are all accessible and correctly cited. The sixth source, fool.com (Motley Fool), is live (HTTP 200) and reputable but is NOT on the allowlist — this is a policy violation that must be remedied.",
    "factual_accuracy": "All Round 1 findings have been addressed correctly. The debt correction from $10 billion to approximately $21.4 billion ($14.7B long-term + $6.7B current) is accurate per CoreWeave's Q4 2025 balance sheet. The new earnings call claims (no maturities until 2029, $18B+ raised, 300bps rate reduction) are plausible and consistent with the broader reporting, but currently sourced only from fool.com, which is not in the allowlist.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. No sensationalism. Appropriate analytical hedging. The additional context from the earnings call about the debt refinancing actually balances the article's risk framing well.",
    "originality": "No duplicate coverage of CoreWeave in recent articles. This is the only CoreWeave Q4 2025 earnings coverage on the site.",
    "concerns": [
      "fool.com is not in the allowlist. The Motley Fool earnings call transcript is the sole source for claims about: (1) no debt maturities until 2029, (2) $18B+ raised in 2025, (3) 300bps weighted average interest rate reduction, (4) approximately $700M in annualized interest savings. These claims must be sourced from an allowlisted outlet or the allowlist must be updated to include fool.com before publication."
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "Replace the fool.com source with an allowlisted alternative. Options: (a) The BusinessWire earnings release already cited likely contains the same refinancing figures from management commentary. (b) CNBC, Bloomberg, Reuters, or other allowlisted outlets may have covered the earnings call. (c) SEC.gov filings may contain the relevant debt structure information. (d) Alternatively, if the earnings call claims cannot be sourced from an allowlisted outlet, remove or rephrase those specific claims.",
      "This is the only required change. All other content and sources are verified and acceptable."
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "The rewrite is a substantial improvement. The debt correction was made accurately and the additional earnings call context strengthens the article's analysis. This submission is very close to publication-ready — one source policy issue must be resolved. Given the quality of the content and the bot's demonstrated care in this rewrite, a third round should be straightforward."
