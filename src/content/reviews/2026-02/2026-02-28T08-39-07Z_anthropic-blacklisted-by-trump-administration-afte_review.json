Hours later, OpenAI struck a rival deal with identical safety principles—accepting the same terms Washington called unacceptable from Anthropic.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nThe months-long standoff between Anthropic and the U.S. Defense Department reached a definitive and consequential conclusion on February 27, 2026. CEO Dario Amodei refused the Pentagon's final contract offer, the Trump administration ordered all federal agencies to phase out Anthropic technology, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth declared the company a \"supply chain risk\" — a designation historically reserved for foreign adversaries. Hours later, OpenAI struck its own Pentagon deal...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Excellent breaking news article with clear structure and strong analytical framing. The OpenAI comparison angle (accepting the same restrictions the Pentagon refused from Anthropic) is the most journalistically significant element and is well-developed.",
    "source_verification": "OPB, ABC News, and DefenseScoop all confirmed accessible and consistent with their cited claims. CBS News is on the allowlist. Both CNBC articles returned CSS-only via WebFetch (likely anti-scraping protection) but are established reputable outlets on the allowlist. Axios URL is incorrect — the story exists at a Feb 27 URL with a different slug; the submitted URL (dated Feb 28) appears non-existent. Key verified facts: $200M contract value confirmed by DefenseScoop; two restrictions (mass surveillance, autonomous weapons) confirmed; Amodei quotes confirmed; supply chain designation confirmed; 6-month transition confirmed; OpenAI deal with same principles confirmed via OPB.",
    "factual_accuracy": "PRIMARY ISSUES: (1) Axios URL incorrect — the date and slug don't match actual Axios coverage. (2) 'Adam Conner of American Progress' not quoted in cited DefenseScoop article. All other major facts verified: $200M contract, supply chain risk designation, Hegseth quotes, Amodei quotes, OpenAI deal terms, 6-month transition period.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. The article accurately presents both the administration's position and Anthropic's position without editorializing. The OpenAI comparison is reported factually without taking sides.",
    "originality": "No duplicate content in published articles. This is a significant, genuinely new breaking news story with no prior coverage.",
    "human_requested_scrutiny": "Heightened scrutiny applied as required. Sources are diverse (OPB/NPR affiliate, CBS News, ABC News, two CNBC articles, DefenseScoop, Axios). No framing bias detected — the article presents the administration's position, Anthropic's position, and expert commentary. The 'Department of War' usage in Amodei's quoted statement is accurately attributed and sourced.",
    "concerns": [
      "Axios URL is incorrect — needs to be replaced with the actual Feb 27 article URL",
      "Expert attribution error: Adam Conner/American Progress quote not found in cited DefenseScoop source"
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "Strong, well-sourced article on an important story. Two targeted corrections — fix the Axios URL and correct the expert attribution — then ready for publication."
