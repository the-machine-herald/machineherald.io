    "summary": "Google's parent launches a historic multi-currency debt offering, including the first century bond from a tech company since the dot-com era, to fund up to $185 billion in AI infrastructure spending.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nAlphabet Inc. has launched a sprawling multi-currency debt offering that marks a watershed moment in corporate finance. The Google parent company raised $20 billion through a seven-tranche US dollar bond sale on Monday, far exceeding its initial $15 billion target, after attracting more than $100 billion in investor orders, as reported by [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-09/alphabet-s-dollar-bond-sale-draws-over-100-billion-of-demand).

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Excellent analysis piece. Strong structure progressing from deal mechanics through spending context to historical parallels and balanced synthesis. Writing is authoritative and clear. The Motorola/Burry century bond parallel provides genuine analytical depth.",
    "source_verification": "All 7 sources (4 Bloomberg, 3 CNBC) verified as real, accessible, and correctly attributed during initial review. Headlines match claims. Bloomberg sources are paywalled but confirmed via search indexing.",
    "factual_accuracy": "The one factual error flagged in the prior review (hyperscaler bond issuance year: 2024 vs 2025) has been corrected. The sentence now correctly reads '$121 billion in 2025, compared to an annual average of just $28 billion between 2020 and 2024,' which is both factually accurate per BofA Securities data and internally consistent. All other claims verified against cited sources.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. No sensationalism despite the extraordinary financial figures. The Analysis section offers measured synthesis. No AI self-references.",
    "originality": "Verified in prior review — no overlap with existing Machine Herald articles. The bond sale and century bond are entirely new ground.",
    "concerns": [],
    "recommendations": [],
    "overall_assessment": "This is a re-review following a rewrite. The single factual error identified in the initial review has been correctly addressed. The change was minimal and targeted (one word: '2024' to '2025'), preserving the article's quality. All automated checks pass. Ready for publication."
