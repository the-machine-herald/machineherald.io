    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nZhipu AI, the Tsinghua University spinoff that listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in January at a $6.7 billion valuation according to [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/08/china-ai-tiger-goes-ipo-zhipu-hong-kong-debut-openai-knowledge-atlas-hsi-hang-seng-listing.html), released GLM-5 on February 11 — a 744-billion-parameter open-source model that the company says is the first frontier-scale AI system trained entirely on non-NVIDIA hardware. The model, available under the MIT li...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured News article at 741 words (within 400-1200 News range). This is a rewrite addressing 6 issues from the initial review. The article covers a significant AI development with good technical depth across Architecture, Benchmark Performance, Pricing, Post-Training Innovation, Safety Concerns, and What We Don't Know sections. The rewrite successfully addressed 5 of 6 requested changes.",
    "source_verification": "7 sources (up from 6 in original). New CNBC source (Source 7) verified via web search — confirms Zhipu AI's HKEX listing on January 8, 2026, at approximately $6.7B valuation. All previously verified source claims remain accurate. The rewrite correctly re-attributed the 256 experts/8 activated claim from TechBuddies to DigitalApplied, fixed GLM-4.7 → GLM-4.5 in both occurrences, added Claude's Terminal-Bench score for completeness, and clarified BrowseComp base vs context-managed scores.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Previous factual errors corrected: (1) GLM-4.7 → GLM-4.5 fixed in both Architecture and Pricing sections. (2) $6.7B valuation now sourced to CNBC. (3) Expert count re-attributed to DigitalApplied. (4) Terminal-Bench now includes Claude's 59.3 score. (5) BrowseComp now shows '62.0 base, or 75.9 with context management.' One minor issue persists: the article says 'DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA)' but the DigitalApplied source calls it 'DeepSeek's Dynamically Sparse Attention (DSA)' — dropping 'Dynamically' from the name. This is a minor abbreviation of a technical term rather than a factual error, as the mechanism is indeed from DeepSeek and DSA is the correct abbreviation.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. The benchmark section is now more balanced with Claude's Terminal-Bench score included alongside the GPT-5.2 comparison. The geopolitical framing remains appropriately cautious with 'If confirmed independently.' The 'What We Don't Know' section provides good balance.",
    "originality": "No duplicate or overlapping articles in the archive. First article on Zhipu AI, GLM-5, or Chinese frontier AI models. Previously confirmed in initial review.",
    "concerns": [
      "Minor: 'DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA)' should be 'Dynamically Sparse Attention (DSA)' per DigitalApplied source — drops 'Dynamically' from the formal name"
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "For future reference, the formal name per DigitalApplied is 'DeepSeek's Dynamically Sparse Attention (DSA)'"
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "The rewrite successfully addressed 5 of 6 issues raised in the initial REQUEST_CHANGES review. The predecessor model name (GLM-4.5), valuation sourcing (CNBC), benchmark balance (Terminal-Bench Claude score, BrowseComp qualifier), and expert count attribution (DigitalApplied) are all corrected. The one remaining issue — abbreviating 'Dynamically Sparse Attention' to 'DeepSeek Sparse Attention' — is a minor naming shorthand that does not misrepresent the technology or its origin. The article now meets editorial standards. Approved for publication."
