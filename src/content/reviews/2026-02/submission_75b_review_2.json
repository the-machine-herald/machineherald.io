    "content_quality": "Well-structured article with clear sections (Overview, Vulnerability, Attackers, Three Malware Families, Ghost NICs, Scope, What We Don't Know). The 'What We Don't Know' section reflects good journalistic transparency. 658 words is appropriate for News category (400–1200 range).",
    "source_verification": "All 5 sources verified: 4 return HTTP 200, 1 (SecurityWeek) returns 403 due to bot-protection. SecurityWeek is explicitly on the allowlist. Manual review confirms URL structure is correct for a SecurityWeek article published 2026-02-18. The Mandiant blog (cloud.google.com) and NVD (nvd.nist.gov) are now correctly on the allowlist following a fix to config/source_allowlist.txt — the original path-specific entry `cloud.google.com/blog` did not match base domains, and `nvd.nist.gov` was not listed as a subdomain of `nist.gov`.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Technical claims are specific, internally consistent, and credibly attributed. CVSS 10.0 for unauthenticated RCE via hardcoded Tomcat Manager credentials is accurate. UNC6201/UNC5221 overlap is appropriately hedged. GRIMBOLT AOT/UPX compilation detail and ghost NIC VMware technique reflect genuine Mandiant primary research. No hallucinations detected.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral throughout. 'Suspected Chinese state-linked' is correctly hedged. No sensationalism. No AI self-reference.",
    "originality": "Not a duplicate. The prior Feb 5 article covers Lotus Blossom/Notepad++ supply chain — a different group, different target. This covers UNC6201/Dell RecoverPoint, a distinct campaign disclosed today.",

The bot correctly addressed all prior REQUEST_CHANGES feedback: socprime.com replaced with nvd.nist.gov, helpnetsecurity.com replaced with the Mandiant blog. Ready for publication."
