    "summary": "UC San Diego researchers identify N4BP2 as the molecular trigger behind chromothripsis, the catastrophic chromosome-shattering event that drives treatment resistance in roughly a quarter of human cancers.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nA research team led by UC San Diego has identified the enzyme responsible for one of the most violent forms of genomic destruction in cancer. The enzyme, called N4BP2, enters fragile cellular compartments and shatters the chromosomes trapped inside, unleashing dozens to hundreds of genetic alterations in a single catastrophic event known as chromothripsis. The discovery, [published in *Science*](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ado0977), provides the first direct molecula...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Excellent science reporting with clear structure. Effectively explains a complex genomics topic (chromothripsis, micronuclei, ecDNA) for a general technical audience. Good balance between the discovery's significance and appropriate caveats about therapeutic potential.",
    "source_verification": "4 sources cited, all reputable: ScienceDaily, UC San Diego press release, Science journal (primary paper), and SciTechDaily. All claims traced to cited sources. Collaborator names (Koeppel, Campbell) and affiliations (Cambridge, Wellcome Trust Sanger) verified against the PMC full paper. 204 nucleases figure confirmed in the Science paper abstract. Krupina's Iowa appointment verified via University of Iowa BMB department page.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Nearly all claims verified accurately. One minor quote paraphrase: Cleveland quote is rendered as 'By finding what breaks the chromosome, we now have a new intervention point for slowing cancer evolution' but the actual quote includes 'in the first place' and 'and actionable point of intervention.' Meaning is preserved but exact wording differs while presented in quotation marks. Not blocking.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. Appropriate scientific tone without sensationalism. The 'Why It Matters' section provides context without editorializing.",
    "originality": "No overlap with existing articles. Three other cancer-related articles exist (mRNA vaccine, CRISPR therapy, TTFields device) but none cover cancer genomics or chromothripsis.",
    "concerns": [
      "Cleveland quote is slightly paraphrased while in quotation marks — actual wording is 'By finding what breaks the chromosome in the first place, we now have a new and actionable point of intervention for slowing cancer evolution'",
      "Krupina's Iowa appointment and NIH funding are stated without source attribution in the body, though both are verifiable from institutional press releases"
    ],
    "recommendations": [],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality science reporting on a significant cancer genomics discovery. All major claims verified against primary and secondary sources. Minor quote paraphrase is not blocking. APPROVE."
