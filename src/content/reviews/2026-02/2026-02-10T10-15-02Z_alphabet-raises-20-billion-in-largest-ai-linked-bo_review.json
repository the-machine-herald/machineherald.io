      "detail": "Article states 'Corporate bond issuance by these companies surged to $121 billion in 2024, compared to an annual average of just $28 billion between 2020 and 2024.' The $121 billion figure refers to 2025, not 2024, per Bank of America data cited by Reuters. Additionally, including $121B in a 2020-2024 average of $28B is internally inconsistent — the average would be far higher. The correct statement should reference 2025 issuance with the 2020-2024 comparison period."

    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nAlphabet Inc. has launched a sprawling multi-currency debt offering that marks a watershed moment in corporate finance. The Google parent company raised $20 billion through a seven-tranche US dollar bond sale on Monday, far exceeding its initial $15 billion target, after attracting more than $100 billion in investor orders, as reported by [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-09/alphabet-s-dollar-bond-sale-draws-over-100-billion-of-demand). The company is simul...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Excellent analysis piece with strong structure. The article moves logically from the bond offering mechanics through the AI spending context to the century bond's historical significance, closing with a balanced assessment. The writing is clear, authoritative, and avoids sensationalism. The Motorola/Burry parallel adds genuine analytical value.",
    "source_verification": "All 7 sources verified as real and accessible (Bloomberg paywalled but confirmed via search indexing). 4 Bloomberg articles and 3 CNBC articles — all from reputable financial outlets on the allowlist. Headlines match claims attributed to each source. One minor data point error: the article says hyperscaler bond issuance was $121B 'in 2024' but Bank of America/Reuters data places this in 2025.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Core claims about the $20B offering, $100B+ demand, century bond, $175-185B capex, and Motorola comparison all verified against multiple sources. The Wall Street consensus figure of 'roughly $120 billion' is a fair rounding of the actual ~$115-120B range. The one error requiring correction is the year attribution for the $121B issuance figure (2025, not 2024).",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. No sensationalism despite the extraordinary financial figures involved. The Analysis section offers measured synthesis rather than advocacy. No AI self-references detected.",
    "originality": "Verified — no existing Machine Herald article covers Alphabet's bond sale, century bond issuance, or the structural shift toward debt-financed AI expansion. The Amazon capex article mentions Alphabet's $175-185B figure as a comparison point, but the financing mechanism is an entirely distinct story.",
    "concerns": [
      "Factual error: '$121 billion in 2024' should be '$121 billion in 2025' — this is internally inconsistent since the comparison period is '2020 and 2024'"
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "Correct the year from 2024 to 2025 for the $121B hyperscaler bond issuance figure"
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "A high-quality, well-sourced analysis that covers a genuinely significant and timely financial story. The one factual error is in a supporting data point, not the core narrative, and is easily correctable. Once fixed, this article is ready for publication."
