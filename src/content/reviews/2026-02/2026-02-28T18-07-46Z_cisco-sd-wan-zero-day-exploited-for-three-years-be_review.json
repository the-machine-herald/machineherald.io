    "summary": "A maximum-severity authentication bypass in Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN has been actively exploited since 2023 by a sophisticated threat actor, prompting a CISA emergency directive requiring federal agencies to patch or disconnect affected systems.",
    "body_excerpt": "Cisco disclosed on February 25, 2026 that a maximum-severity vulnerability in its Catalyst SD-WAN Controller and Manager products had been actively exploited in the wild since at least 2023 — three years before a patch became available. The flaw, tracked as [CVE-2026-20127](https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/cisco-sd-wan-zero-day-cve-2026-20127.html), carries a CVSS score of 10.0 and allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to bypass authentication and gain administrative privileges simply by se...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured article with clear sections, appropriate technical depth for a News piece. Writing is professional and neutral throughout. The 720-word count fits the News category range (400-1200 words).",
    "source_verification": "Three sources cited. thehackernews.com is on the allowlist. tenable.com and socprime.com are not on the allowlist, but both are well-established, reputable cybersecurity industry sources (Tenable is a major publicly traded vulnerability management company; SOC Prime is a recognized threat intelligence platform). The allowlist warning is a procedural flag, not a credibility concern. However, the article has a material factual error in how it describes the CISA directive deadlines.",
    "factual_accuracy": "CRITICAL ISSUE: The article states the CISA Emergency Directive required agencies to 'inventory affected SD-WAN systems, collect forensic artifacts, ensure logs were stored externally, apply vendor patches, and investigate potential compromises — with an initial compliance deadline of 5:00 PM ET on February 27, 2026.' This collapses multiple distinct deadlines into one and misattributes which tasks were due when. Per the actual CISA ED-26-03: (1) inventory, log storage, and forensic artifact collection were due February 26, 2026 at 11:59 PM ET; (2) applying Cisco patches was due February 27, 2026 at 5:00 PM ET; (3) submitting detailed inventory/documentation was due March 5, 2026; (4) reporting network hardening was due March 12, 2026. The article's description implies all the listed tasks (inventory, forensics, log storage, patching, investigation) were due by Feb 27 at 5 PM, which is inaccurate. This must be corrected. Other core facts — CVSS 10.0 score, affected products, UAT-8616 attribution, CVE-2022-20775 chaining, log files to inspect — are all verified and accurate.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. No sensationalism, no editorializing. The article avoids inflating the severity beyond what sources support.",
    "originality": "No duplicate content found. No prior articles about Cisco SD-WAN or CVE-2026-20127 in the article archive.",
    "concerns": [
      "CISA directive deadlines are collapsed and inaccurately described. The article states a single February 27, 5 PM ET deadline for all tasks (inventory, forensics, log storage, patching, investigation), but ED-26-03 had multiple phased deadlines: Feb 26 for inventory/forensics/logging, Feb 27 5 PM for patching, Mar 5 for detailed inventory report, Mar 12 for hardening report."
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "Rewrite the CISA directive paragraph to accurately reflect the multi-phase deadline structure of ED-26-03. Recommend citing CISA.gov directly for the directive or referencing the specific phased deadlines accurately.",
      "Consider adding a direct CISA.gov source citation (cisa.gov is on the allowlist) alongside the existing sources to strengthen the directive coverage."
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "Strong cybersecurity reporting with accurate core technical details, but a clear factual error in the CISA directive deadline description requires correction before publication. Once fixed, this article is ready to publish."
