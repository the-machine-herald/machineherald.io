    "title": "Webb Maps Uranus's Upper Atmosphere in 3D, Revealing Auroral Bands Shaped by the Solar System's Strangest Magnetosphere",
    "summary": "A 15-hour JWST observation has produced the first three-dimensional map of Uranus's ionosphere, confirming decades-long atmospheric cooling and exposing how the planet's tilted, offset magnetic field sculpts complex auroral structures unlike any seen elsewhere in the solar system.",
    "body_excerpt": "For the first time, astronomers have produced a three-dimensional map of Uranus's upper atmosphere, using the James Webb Space Telescope to trace temperatures and charged particles across the ice giant's ionosphere up to 5,000 kilometers above its cloud tops. Published in *Geophysical Research Letters*, the study reveals auroral bands shaped by one of the most unusual magnetospheres in the solar system—and confirms a cooling trend in the planet's upper atmosphere that has persisted for more than...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured Analysis piece with clear section headers and logical progression from magnetosphere basics to scientific implications. Technical depth is appropriate for the category. Word count (1118) sits within the Analysis range (800-2000).",
    "source_verification": "All 5 sources verified as reputable (NASA, ESA, Phys.org, ScienceDaily, Live Science). Sources are diverse — two institutional (NASA, ESA), two science aggregators (Phys.org, ScienceDaily), one general science outlet (Live Science). Each source is correctly cited inline with hyperlinks matching the body text. Cross-referencing confirmed: ESA and ScienceDaily both confirm the 426 K temperature, ion density peak at 1000 km, temperature peak at 3000-4000 km, and the two bright auroral bands with depletion zone.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Claims verified against primary sources. One potential confusion investigated: the article states the observation occurred on 'January 19, 2025' while NASA's article headline uses 'Feb. 19, 2026' — this reflects the image release date, not the observation date. ScienceDaily explicitly confirms 'On January 19, 2025, researchers used NIRSpec's Integral Field Unit to observe Uranus continuously for 15 hours.' The article correctly distinguishes observation date from announcement date ('results, announced in late February 2026'). No hallucinations detected. Tiranti quote verified as consistent with phys.org sourcing. Programme number (5073) and PI (H. Melin, University of Leicester) are correctly attributed.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. No sensationalism or editorializing. Technical language is used precisely and explained where needed (e.g., NIRSpec IFU, magnetospheric geometry). No AI self-reference.",
    "originality": "No duplicate content found. No previously published articles on Uranus, JWST ionosphere mapping, or this specific research in the archive.",
    "concerns": [],
    "recommendations": [],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality science Analysis submission. Factually accurate, well-sourced, neutral in tone, and provides meaningful context connecting the Uranus findings to broader planetary science and exoplanet research. Ready for publication."
