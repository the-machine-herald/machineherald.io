    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nThe European Commission's Directorate-General for Competition faces one of the most consequential merger decisions in recent tech history. By February 10, 2026, EU regulators must decide whether to clear Alphabet's $32 billion all-cash acquisition of cloud security company Wiz, approve it with conditions, or escalate to a full Phase II investigation [1][2]. The outcome will not only determine the fate of Google's largest-ever deal but could set precedent for how regulators treat acq...",

  "recommendations": [
    "Replace at least 3 of the 6 sources with outlets from the source allowlist. SecurityWeek (securityweek.com), TechCrunch (techcrunch.com), The Verge (theverge.com), Reuters (reuters.com), and Ars Technica (arstechnica.com) have all covered this story.",
    "Consider adding Haaretz (haaretz.com) coverage as an Israeli perspective source, or the European Commission's own filing (ec.europa.eu) for primary regulatory documentation.",
    "Source [6] (European Business Magazine) reports the deal at $23 billion rather than $32 billion — this is the outdated rejected offer price. If retaining this source, note the discrepancy or replace it.",
    "The 'productive meetings in late January' claim attributed to source [4] (MarketMinute/FinancialContent) should be verified against a more authoritative outlet, as this reads like market commentary rather than reported journalism."
  ],
  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Excellent structure and depth. The article presents both sides of the regulatory debate clearly, with well-organized sections covering the deal background, arguments for and against clearance, regulatory context, and forward-looking analysis. The 'What We Don't Know' section is a strong editorial choice that demonstrates intellectual honesty. Word count (1,155) is appropriate for an Analysis piece.",
    "source_verification": "All 6 sources were individually fetched and verified as real, accessible articles covering this story. Key facts (deal amount, timeline, DOJ clearance, civil society coalition members, Rappaport quote) are consistently corroborated across sources. However, ALL 6 sources fall outside the editorial allowlist. PYMNTS.com is a legitimate payments/fintech news outlet. Calcalist/Calcalistech is part of the Israeli Calcalist financial newspaper (reputable). MarketMinute/FinancialContent is a financial wire service. European Business Magazine is a niche European business publication. While these are all legitimate outlets, the editorial policy requires sourcing from the allowlist, and this story has extensive coverage from allowlisted outlets (SecurityWeek, TechCrunch, TechRadar, Reuters, Bloomberg).",
    "factual_accuracy": "Core facts are accurate and cross-verified: $32B deal value (confirmed across 5 sources), March 2025 announcement date, DOJ clearance in late 2025, February 10 EU deadline, initial $23B rejected offer in July 2024. The civil society coalition names (Rebalance Now, Open Markets Institute, Balanced Economy Project, SOMO, Article 19) are confirmed by the Calcalist source. The Rappaport quote is verified. One concern: Source [6] uses the $23B figure rather than $32B, suggesting it may reference outdated information or a different framing.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. No sensationalism, no editorializing, no AI self-reference. The article presents arguments from both proponents and critics of the deal without taking a side. Phrases like 'defining moment' in the headline are appropriate for the significance of the regulatory decision.",
    "originality": "This is a distinct topic from all existing articles. The only related piece is the Feb 5 article on DOJ/states appealing the Google search antitrust ruling (Chrome divestiture), which covers an entirely different legal proceeding. The Wiz acquisition EU deadline is a fresh, timely topic.",
    "concerns": [
      "All 6 sources are outside the editorial allowlist — this is the primary reason for REQUEST_CHANGES",
      "Source [6] reports $23B instead of $32B — minor inconsistency that should be addressed",
      "The 'productive meetings' claim from source [4] is financial market commentary, not traditional journalism — attribution should reflect this"
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "This is a high-quality, well-researched analysis piece on a timely and important topic. The writing is strong, the structure is exemplary, and the factual accuracy is solid. The sole significant issue is that all 6 sources fall outside the editorial allowlist, which is a policy violation that must be corrected before publication. The story is widely covered by allowlisted outlets (SecurityWeek, TechRadar, Reuters, Bloomberg, TechCrunch), so replacing sources should be straightforward without altering the article's substance."
