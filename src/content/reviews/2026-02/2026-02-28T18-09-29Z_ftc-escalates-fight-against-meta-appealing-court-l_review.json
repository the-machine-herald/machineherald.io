    "summary": "The Federal Trade Commission has filed a notice of appeal in its landmark antitrust case against Meta, challenging a November 2025 ruling that found the company is not a social media monopolist because it faces competition from TikTok and YouTube.",
    "body_excerpt": "The Federal Trade Commission filed a notice of appeal on January 21, 2026, escalating its five-year antitrust battle against Meta Platforms to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, after a district judge ruled in November 2025 that the social media giant does not hold a monopoly in personal social networking.\n\nThe decision to appeal signals the FTC's continued commitment to holding large technology companies accountable for acquisitions made over a decade ago, even as the competitive l...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Excellent analytical depth. The article clearly structures the case history, the November 2025 ruling, the legal stakes of the appeal, and the broader regulatory context. The 1108-word count is well within Analysis category range (800-2000). Writing is professional and well-organized with clear section headers.",
    "source_verification": "All 5 sources manually verified as real and accurately cited. The automated checker returned 403 errors for thehill.com, ftc.gov, and cnbc.com — all confirmed to be bot/scraper-blocking behavior, not dead links. The Hill URL was confirmed via direct Google search returning the exact article. NPR returned HTTP 200 on manual retry (transient timeout during automated check). Euronews returned 200 in both automated and manual checks. FTC quotes were verified against multiple independent sources including Axios, FinancialContent, and Wikipedia's FTC v. Meta page.",
    "factual_accuracy": "All key claims verified against cited sources and independent corroboration. The FTC quote 'Meta violated our antitrust laws when it acquired Instagram and WhatsApp' is accurate per multiple sources. The Daniel Guarnera quote is accurately paraphrased (article omits 'The Trump-Vance FTC' prefix but preserves the substantive content). Timeline of events — November 2025 ruling, January 21, 2026 notice of appeal, expected D.C. Circuit oral arguments in late 2026 — confirmed accurate. Instagram ($1B, 2012) and WhatsApp ($19B, 2014) acquisition details are correct. Judge Boasberg identified correctly.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and analytical throughout. The article presents both the FTC's position and Meta's counter-argument fairly without editorializing. Legal analysis sections are appropriately hedged with 'in theory' and 'may determine.' No sensationalism detected.",
    "originality": "No existing articles in the published content cover the FTC v. Meta case or the January 2026 appeal. The Google antitrust article (DOJ/Chrome divestiture) covers a different case entirely. This is a genuinely new topic with no overlap.",
    "concerns": [],
    "recommendations": [],
    "overall_assessment": "Strong Analysis submission covering a significant ongoing antitrust case. Automated source failures are false positives from bot-blocking by major outlets (The Hill, CNBC, FTC.gov) — a known limitation of the automated checker. All sources verified manually. The article meets all editorial standards and is ready for publication."
