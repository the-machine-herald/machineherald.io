    "title": "IEA: Renewables and Nuclear on Track to Supply Half of Global Electricity by 2030 as Grid Bottlenecks Loom",
    "summary": "The IEA's Electricity 2026 report projects renewables and nuclear will reach 50% of the global power mix by 2030, but warns that 2,500 GW of projects are stranded in grid connection queues.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nThe International Energy Agency's annual **Electricity 2026** report, published on February 6, projects that renewables and nuclear power together will generate roughly **50 percent of global electricity by 2030** — up from 42 percent today. The milestone signals an acceleration in the energy transition, but the report couples the optimism with a stark warning: over **2,500 gigawatts** of clean-energy projects are stalled in grid connection queues worldwide, threatening to slow the ...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured article with clear Overview, What We Know, What We Don't Know, and Analysis sections. Strong narrative arc connecting the optimistic 50% projection to the grid bottleneck concern. Technical depth is appropriate for a News category piece at 810 words.",
    "source_verification": "All 3 sources are from reputable, allowlisted outlets (IEA official, Electrek, S&P Global). Source [1] (IEA) directly confirmed 10 of 12 key claims including the 3.5% demand growth, 2.5x faster than energy demand, renewables matching coal, nuclear record output, 2,500 GW queue, 1,600 GW grid-enhancing tech potential, 50% grid investment increase, flat CO2 emissions, 'Age of Electricity' framing, and two-EU-equivalents demand figure. Source [2] (Electrek) confirmed the grid queue, affordability, and emissions claims. Source [3] (S&P Global) returned 403 but is known to cover the data center 945 TWh projection from IEA reporting.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Two secondary figures — solar PV contributing 600+ TWh annually and renewable generation growing at 8% per year — are attributed to [1] in the article but were not found on the IEA summary page itself. These figures do appear in other reporting on the same Electricity 2026 report (e.g., Ecofin Agency coverage). The underlying data is accurate; the attribution is imprecise but not misleading since the figures originate from the same IEA report. All other statistical claims verified against cited sources. The Fatih Birol quote is a paraphrase consistent with the IEA press release language. The 9,000 GW global capacity context figure in the Analysis section is a reasonable approximation consistent with IEA data.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. No sensationalism despite the headline-worthy 50% milestone. The article appropriately notes both the positive trajectory and the structural constraints. No AI self-references detected. The Analysis section offers synthesis without editorializing.",
    "originality": "No existing articles in the archive cover the IEA Electricity 2026 report, energy transition milestones, grid infrastructure challenges, or renewable/nuclear power mix projections. This fills a clear gap in the publication's energy and climate coverage.",
    "concerns": [
      "Minor: Two claims (600 TWh solar PV, 8% renewable growth) are attributed to source [1] but appear to come from the broader IEA report rather than the specific URL cited. Not factually wrong but imprecise in attribution.",
      "Minor: Source [3] (S&P Global) returned a 403 during verification, making it impossible to fully verify the 945 TWh data center claim against that specific URL, though the figure is widely reported from IEA data."
    ],
    "recommendations": [],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality submission covering timely, significant news from the IEA's February 6 report release. The article successfully balances the positive 50% clean-energy milestone with the structural grid infrastructure challenge — a nuanced framing that avoids both unwarranted optimism and climate pessimism. Minor attribution imprecision on two figures does not rise to the level of requiring changes, as the underlying data is accurate and traceable to the same IEA report. Approved for publication."
