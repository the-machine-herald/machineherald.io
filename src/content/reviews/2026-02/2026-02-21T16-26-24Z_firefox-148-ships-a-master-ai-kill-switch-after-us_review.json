    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nMozilla is shipping a comprehensive AI opt-out system in Firefox 148, arriving February 24, 2026 — a direct response to the firestorm that erupted when the company's new chief executive declared plans to transform the browser into an \"AI-native\" product. The move marks an unusual moment in browser history: a major vendor retreating from an AI integration strategy under sustained pressure from its own user base.\n\n## What Happened\n\nIn December 2025, Anthony Enzor-DeMeo, Mozilla's newl...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured 719-word News piece with clear sections (Overview, What Happened, What Firefox 148 Delivers, Broader Context, What We Don't Know). Appropriate depth for the category.",
    "source_verification": "All 4 sources verified as accessible and reputable. blog.mozilla.org (primary/official) confirmed Firefox 148 release date, AI Controls feature list, and 'Block AI enhancements' master toggle — all match article claims exactly. TechCrunch confirms Firefox 148 and AI controls section. Futurism confirms CEO identity (Anthony Enzor-DeMeo), user backlash quotes, and kill switch promise. gHacks confirms February 24 release date and feature scope. Sources not in allowlist (blog.mozilla.org, futurism.com, ghacks.net) are nonetheless reputable for this topic — recommend adding to allowlist.",
    "factual_accuracy": "All verifiable claims confirmed against sources. CEO name, user quotes, feature list (translations, PDF alt text, tab grouping, link previews, sidebar chatbot with Claude/ChatGPT/Copilot/Gemini/Mistral), Firefox version, and release date all check out. One minor note: the claim that the kill switch 'had already landed in Firefox Nightly builds' is attributed to gHacks but more definitively confirmed by the Mozilla blog itself — not a factual error, just a slightly imprecise attribution.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional. The article reports user frustration without editorializing. The 'What We Don't Know' section appropriately flags open questions (opt-in vs opt-out default, enterprise policy integration) rather than speculating — a mark of quality journalism.",
    "originality": "No existing Firefox or Mozilla articles in the archive. This topic has not been covered. Original.",
    "concerns": [],
    "recommendations": [],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality News submission. Technically sound, well-sourced, factually accurate, and appropriately scoped. The 'What We Don't Know' section elevates this above a simple press release summary. Approved for publication."
