Only Stellantis ($28-32B) is roughly accurate. These appear to be outdated figures from 2024. The comparison point still holds (Waymo at $126B exceeds all three combined), but the specific dollar amounts are materially wrong and must be updated with current market caps."

    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nWaymo, the Alphabet-owned autonomous vehicle company, announced on February 2, 2026, that it has raised $16 billion in what is the largest investment ever in an autonomous vehicle company [1]. The round values Waymo at $126 billion post-money — more than doubling its $45 billion valuation from its $5.6 billion Series C in October 2024 [2].\n\nThe funding was led by Dragoneer Investment Group, DST Global, and Sequoia Capital, with participation from Andreessen Horowitz, Mubadala Capita...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Excellent structure and depth. Well-organized with clear sections covering funding details, growth trajectory, expansion plans, fleet manufacturing, competitive landscape, and unknowns. The Analysis section provides genuine editorial value with thoughtful commentary on international expansion significance and valuation scrutiny. At 1,168 words, it is appropriately comprehensive for an Analysis piece.",
    "source_verification": "5 sources from 4 outlets: Waymo official blog (primary), Electrek, CNBC (x2), and TechCrunch. All 5 sources verified as accessible and reputable. The Waymo blog provides the authoritative announcement; Electrek and CNBC provide independent reporting; TechCrunch provides pre-announcement context. CNBC May 2025 article correctly sourced for manufacturing details. 18 of 19 specific factual claims verified against cited sources. One set of claims (automaker market caps) not attributed to any source and found to be inaccurate.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Core Waymo claims are accurate: $16B raised, $126B valuation, investor roster, 15M rides in 2025, 400K+ weekly rides, 127M autonomous miles, 90% crash reduction, expansion to 20+ cities including Tokyo and London. TechCrunch's $110B figure is the pre-money valuation, consistent with $126B post-money ($110B + $16B). CRITICAL ISSUE: The Valuation Context paragraph cites GM at $48B, Ford at $39B, and Stellantis at $33B — these GM and Ford figures are substantially outdated. Current market caps are approximately $75-78B (GM) and $54-55B (Ford). These unsourced comparison figures must be corrected.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. No sensationalism despite the record-breaking nature of the funding round. The article appropriately notes uncertainties (profitability timeline, revenue figures, regulatory approvals). Investor quotes are properly attributed and not promotional. The Analysis section maintains editorial balance by noting the valuation scrutiny and Tesla competitive threat.",
    "originality": "No existing Waymo or autonomous vehicle coverage in the article archive. This fills an important gap in technology/transportation coverage. The story is timely (announced February 2, published within days).",
    "concerns": [
      "Automaker market cap figures (GM $48B, Ford $39B) are materially incorrect and not attributed to any source",
      "The article includes the legacy provenance record footnote at the end which is no longer needed"
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "Correct GM and Ford market capitalization figures to current values, or remove specific dollar comparisons and use a more general framing",
      "If keeping specific market cap figures, cite a source for them (e.g., Google Finance, Bloomberg)"
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality Analysis submission covering a significant autonomous vehicle milestone. The article demonstrates strong sourcing, balanced reporting, and genuine editorial insight. The single blocking issue is the incorrect automaker valuation figures which must be corrected before publication. Once fixed, this is ready for immediate publication."
