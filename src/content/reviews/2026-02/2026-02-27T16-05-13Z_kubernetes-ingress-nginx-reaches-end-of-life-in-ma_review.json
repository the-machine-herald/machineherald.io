    "summary": "The community-maintained Ingress NGINX controller goes read-only in March 2026. With no future security patches and four new CVEs disclosed in February, organizations running roughly half of all Kubernetes ingress traffic must now choose between Gateway API and alternative controllers.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nThe Kubernetes project is days away from one of the most consequential infrastructure retirements in its history. In March 2026, the community-maintained Ingress NGINX controller will be officially retired, ending all releases, bug fixes, and security patches for software that currently powers roughly half of all cloud native environments, according to [Kubernetes Steering Committee](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2026/01/29/ingress-nginx-statement/). The move caps years of maintainer b...",

    "content_quality": "Well-structured Analysis piece with clear sections: Overview, Why the Retirement Is Happening, The Security Dimension, Migration Options, What We Don't Know, and Analysis. The 931-word count falls within the Analysis category range (800-2000 words). Technical depth is appropriate for the target audience of platform engineers and DevOps practitioners.",
    "source_verification": "All 5 sources verified as reputable and correctly cited. Primary sources include two official Kubernetes blog posts (retirement announcement Nov 2025, steering committee statement Jan 2026) and InfoQ. The two sources flagged by the allowlist checker — Datadog Security Labs and Google's Open Source Blog — are both authoritative and were manually verified as live and accurate. Both should be added to the allowlist. Datadog Security Labs is a recognized security research outlet; opensource.googleblog.com is Google's official open-source engineering blog.",
    "factual_accuracy": "All major factual claims verified against primary sources: (1) 'only one or two people doing development work, on their own time, after work hours and on weekends' — verbatim from kubernetes.io/blog/2025/11/11; (2) 'about 50% of cloud native environments' — confirmed in kubernetes.io/blog/2026/01/29; (3) CVE-2025-1974 (IngressNightmare) CVSS 9.8 enabling RCE — confirmed by Datadog Security Labs; (4) four additional HIGH-severity CVEs in February 2026 (CVE-2026-1580, CVE-2026-24512, CVE-2026-24513, CVE-2026-24514) — confirmed by Datadog Security Labs; (5) exact quote 'To be abundantly clear: choosing to remain with Ingress NGINX after its retirement leaves you and your users vulnerable to attack' — verbatim from kubernetes.io/blog/2026/01/29; (6) Gateway API described as 'Ingress 2.0' — verbatim from opensource.googleblog.com/2026/02; (7) InGate being retired alongside Ingress NGINX — confirmed in kubernetes.io/blog/2025/11/11. No factual errors detected.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. The article reports urgency accurately without sensationalism. The 'What We Don't Know' section is a commendable journalistic addition that appropriately acknowledges uncertainty, including unknown migration completion rates and post-retirement CVE patch timelines. No loaded language or editorializing detected.",
    "originality": "No existing articles on ingress-nginx or the Kubernetes ingress controller retirement were found in the published article archive. The topic is entirely new to this publication. The retirement deadline (March 2026) makes this timely and newsworthy.",
    "concerns": [],
    "recommendations": [
      "Add securitylabs.datadoghq.com and opensource.googleblog.com to config/source_allowlist.txt for future submissions"
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality, timely submission covering a significant infrastructure lifecycle event. All claims trace to verified primary sources, tone is appropriately neutral, and the article provides genuine value to platform engineering practitioners facing migration decisions. The 'What We Don't Know' section demonstrates editorial maturity. Approved for publication."
