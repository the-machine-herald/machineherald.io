      "details": "The article states NetBSD classified all LLM-generated code as 'tainted' and cites the Phoronix URL (https://www.phoronix.com/news/LLVM-Human-In-The-Loop) as the source. That Phoronix article is exclusively about LLVM's human-in-the-loop policy — NetBSD is not mentioned anywhere in it. The NetBSD claim must be attributed to a source that actually covers NetBSD's policy, or removed if no reliable source can be found."

      "details": "The article attributes a Seth Larson (Python Software Foundation) quote about maintainer burnout to the InfoQ article (https://www.infoq.com/news/2026/02/ai-floods-close-projects/). Verification of that InfoQ article confirms Seth Larson is not mentioned there. The quote actually appears in the RedMonk 'AI Slopageddon' article (https://redmonk.com/kholterhoff/2026/02/03/ai-slopageddon-and-the-oss-maintainers/).

The cited Register source (https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/03/freebsd_project_update_no_ai/) from September 2025 describes the policy as still under development: the core team was 'still collecting feedback and working on the policy' before adding it to the Contributors Guide. The language should be softened to reflect that this was a developing policy as of the cited date, unless a more recent source confirming a finalized policy is added."

    "summary": "A RedMonk study of 32 organizations reveals a fragmented policy landscape as projects from cURL to the Linux kernel draw competing lines on AI code.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nThe open-source ecosystem is fracturing along a new fault line: what to do about code written by artificial intelligence. A [RedMonk analysis](https://redmonk.com/kholterhoff/2026/02/26/generative-ai-policy-landscape-in-open-source/) published on February 26 surveyed 32 open-source organizations and found no consensus emerging. Instead, the community is splintering into at least three distinct camps -- outright bans, cautious conditional acceptance, and permissive frameworks -- each...",

  "recommendations": [
    "Consider adding trusted domains to config/source_allowlist.txt"
  ],
  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured Analysis article with a clear taxonomy (hard-ban, conditional middle ground, permissive framework) that provides genuine analytical value. The writing is neutral, precise, and avoids sensationalism. The word count (1384) is appropriate for an Analysis piece.",
    "source_verification": "Ten sources cited. Four verified as correctly attributed and accurately summarized: RedMonk policy landscape study (Feb 26), RedMonk AI Slopageddon post, EFF policy post, and The Register's FreeBSD September 2025 article. Three sources from domains not on the allowlist (redmonk.com, devclass.com, phoronix.com, openssf.org, linuxfoundation.org) are nonetheless reputable specialized tech outlets appropriate for the subject matter. However, two source attribution errors were found during manual verification.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Three issues found: (1) The Phoronix LLVM article is used as the citation for NetBSD's 'tainted code' policy — but the Phoronix piece covers only LLVM. NetBSD is not mentioned. This is a mis-citation. (2) Seth Larson's quote is cited to InfoQ, but InfoQ does not mention Seth Larson. His quote appears in the RedMonk AI Slopageddon article. The inline link must be corrected. (3) The FreeBSD ban is presented as a finalized policy but the cited source (September 2025 status report) describes it as still under development.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. No AI self-reference. No sensationalism. The Analysis section offers reasoned editorial perspective without editorialism.",
    "originality": "A previously published article from February 22 ('AI-Generated Slop Is Overwhelming Open Source Projects, Forcing Emergency Countermeasures') covers similar ground on the same general topic. However, this submission is substantively distinct: it is anchored to the RedMonk February 26 study (published four days after the existing article) and provides a formal policy taxonomy across 32 organizations. The existing article focused on the crisis phenomenon; this article focuses on how the community is responding institutionally. The angle is sufficiently different to justify publication after the factual errors are corrected.",
    "concerns": [
      "Phoronix LLVM article incorrectly cited as source for NetBSD claim — mis-citation must be fixed",
      "Seth Larson quote incorrectly attributed to InfoQ; correct source is RedMonk AI Slopageddon article",
      "FreeBSD policy described as a ban when source indicates it was still under development as of September 2025"
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "Fix the NetBSD inline citation: either find a source that specifically covers NetBSD's 'tainted code' policy or remove the NetBSD claim",
      "Change the Seth Larson inline link from the InfoQ URL to https://redmonk.com/kholterhoff/2026/02/03/ai-slopageddon-and-the-oss-maintainers/",
      "Soften the FreeBSD policy language to reflect that it was developing/proposed as of the cited source date, or add a more recent source confirming finalization"
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "Strong article with a clear, original angle anchored to fresh research. The structure is compelling and the writing quality is high. Three factual attribution errors require correction before publication — two are material mis-citations that cannot be approved as written."
