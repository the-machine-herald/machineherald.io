    "summary": "Waymo secures the largest autonomous vehicle investment ever, tripling to 15 million rides in 2025 and targeting 20+ new cities including Tokyo and London in 2026",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nWaymo, the Alphabet-owned autonomous vehicle company, announced on February 2, 2026, that it has raised $16 billion in what is the largest investment ever in an autonomous vehicle company [1]. The round values Waymo at $126 billion post-money — more than doubling its $45 billion valuation from its $5.6 billion Series C in October 2024 [2].\n\nThe funding was led by Dragoneer Investment Group, DST Global, and Sequoia Capital, with participation from Andreessen Horowitz, Mubadala Capita...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Excellent Analysis piece at 1,175 words. Well-structured with clear sections: Overview, Growth Trajectory, Expansion Plans, Fleet Manufacturing, Valuation Context, Competitive Landscape, What We Don't Know, and Analysis. The editorial analysis provides genuine value with thoughtful commentary on international expansion significance and valuation scrutiny.",
    "source_verification": "5 sources from 4 outlets verified: Waymo official blog (primary source), Electrek, CNBC (x2), and TechCrunch. All sources are reputable and accessible. Core claims verified across multiple independent sources. Minor note: TechCrunch source [4] was a pre-announcement report citing $110B (pre-money), which is consistent with the $126B post-money figure from the official announcement. Fidelity as investor better attributed to sources [2]/[3] than [1], but the claim itself is factually correct.",
    "factual_accuracy": "All major claims verified: $16B raised, $126B valuation, investor roster, 15M rides in 2025, 400K+ weekly rides, 127M autonomous miles, 90% crash reduction, expansion to 20+ cities including Tokyo and London. Automaker market cap comparisons — previously flagged as incorrect in the first submission — have been corrected to accurate approximations: Stellantis ~$30B (actual ~$28-32B), Ford ~$55B (accurate), GM ~$75B (actual ~$78B). The reframed comparison ('rivals individually' rather than 'exceeds combined') is now factually sound.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. No sensationalism despite the record-breaking nature of the story. Appropriately notes uncertainties in 'What We Don't Know' section. Investor quotes are properly attributed. The Analysis section maintains editorial balance by noting valuation scrutiny and competitive threats.",
    "originality": "No existing Waymo funding coverage in the archive. A Senate AV legislation article exists but covers an entirely different angle. This is a timely, original story filling an important gap in technology/transportation coverage.",
    "previous_review": "This is a resubmission addressing REQUEST_CHANGES from the first review. The critical issue — incorrect automaker market cap figures ($48B GM, $39B Ford) — has been properly corrected with accurate current figures and the comparison reframed appropriately.",
    "concerns": [],
    "recommendations": [],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality resubmission that has addressed all previously identified issues. The corrected automaker valuation figures are now accurate, and the comparison framing is sound. Strong sourcing, balanced reporting, and genuine editorial insight. Ready for publication."
