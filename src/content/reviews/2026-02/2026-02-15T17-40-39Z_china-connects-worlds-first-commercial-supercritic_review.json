    "summary": "Two 15-megawatt units at a Guizhou steel plant mark the first commercial deployment of a power cycle concept proposed in 1948, claiming 50% higher efficiency than steam.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nThe China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) has connected the world's first commercial supercritical carbon dioxide power generator to the electrical grid, marking the culmination of a power cycle concept first proposed in 1948. The facility, known as Chaotan One, comprises two 15-megawatt units installed at the Shougang Shuicheng Steel plant in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, where it converts industrial waste heat into electricity using pressurized CO₂ instead of steam, according ...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured News article at 821 words (within 400-1200 News range). Excellent organization with Overview, What We Know (subdivided into How It Works, Engineering Breakthroughs, Efficiency Claims, The Race with the US), What We Don't Know, and Looking Ahead sections. Technical depth is strong — the vacuum diffusion welding description, microchannel heat exchanger specifications (218 parameter combos, 829 days, 27 optimization rounds), and supercritical state physics give the article real substance. The 'What We Don't Know' section is particularly valuable, presenting CleanTechnica's skeptical analysis of durability and fouling risks alongside the achievement claims.",
    "source_verification": "All 5 sources accessed and verified. Interesting Engineering, Prototyping China, and SCMP confirmed as legitimate outlets covering the story. CleanTechnica provided valuable skeptical counterpoint. Futura Sciences offered additional technical context. Of approximately 30 individual claims checked, 26 were fully verified, 3 were partially verified (correct facts attributed to the wrong source), and 1 contained a detail not in the attributed source.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Core facts are accurate: Chaotan One is real, two 15-MW units at Shougang Shuicheng Steel plant in Liupanshui, Guizhou. Grid connection announced November 10, 2025 by CNNC's Nuclear Power Institute (confirmed by SCMP). 17 years of research (since ~2008-2009). Engineering breakthroughs (dry gas sealing, microchannel heat exchangers) verified in detail by Prototyping China. STEP project details (10 MW, San Antonio, GTI Energy, 4 MW at 500°C) verified by SCMP. Four attribution issues identified: (1) 'Shougang Shuicheng Steel' plant name attributed to Interesting Engineering but that source only says 'a steel factory' — the name comes from SCMP and Xinhua coverage. (2) 'November 2025' grid connection date attributed to Prototyping China but that source says 'end of 2025' — the November date comes from SCMP. (3) 'Solar thermal plants' listed as a future application attributed to Futura Sciences, but that source mentions nuclear plants, mobile power units, and spacecraft generators — NOT solar thermal. Solar thermal IS a legitimate sCO2 application (documented in DOE literature) but is not in this source. (4) The 31°C / 7.4 MPa supercritical threshold values are correct physical constants for CO2 but are NOT stated in the Futura Sciences article they're attributed to.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. The article balances the achievement narrative with substantive skepticism in the 'What We Don't Know' section, citing CleanTechnica's durability concerns and fouling risks. The 40-70% seal degradation probability is properly contextualized as analysis rather than established fact. The U.S./China comparison is handled factually without nationalist framing.",
    "originality": "No duplicate or overlapping articles found in the archive. First article covering supercritical CO2 power generation, CNNC, or waste heat recovery technology.",
    "concerns": [
      "'Solar thermal plants' as a future application is attributed to Futura Sciences but that source does not mention solar thermal — it mentions nuclear, mobile power, and spacecraft only",
      "31°C / 7.4 MPa supercritical threshold values not found in the attributed Futura Sciences source (correct physics but unsourced from that article)",
      "'November 2025' date attributed to Prototyping China which only says 'end of 2025' — the specific November date comes from SCMP",
      "'Shougang Shuicheng Steel' plant name not in the Interesting Engineering source it is attributed to (confirmed by SCMP and other sources)"
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "Consider sourcing the solar thermal claim to DOE literature rather than Futura Sciences, or remove it from the Futura Sciences attribution",
      "The 31°C/7.4 MPa values could be presented as established scientific fact rather than attributed to a specific article"
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "Strong News submission covering a genuine engineering milestone with excellent technical depth and balanced reporting. The five sources provide good coverage from multiple angles — official reporting (SCMP, Interesting Engineering), detailed technical coverage (Prototyping China), skeptical analysis (CleanTechnica), and international context (Futura Sciences). The attribution issues are minor — all four involve correct facts attributed to slightly wrong sources within the same story, not fabricated claims. The most notable concern is the 'solar thermal plants' mention attributed to Futura Sciences when that source does not include it, but solar thermal is a well-documented sCO2 application from DOE literature. None of these issues rise to the level of blocking publication. Approved."
