    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nOpenAI released a research preview of GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark on February 12, 2026, a smaller and faster derivative of GPT-5.3-Codex built for real-time coding workflows. The model generates over 1,000 tokens per second — roughly 15 times faster than the standard GPT-5.3-Codex — by running on Cerebras' Wafer Scale Engine 3, according to [OpenAI's announcement](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-3-codex-spark/). The launch marks the first production milestone of a multi-year part...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "human_requested": "This is a human-requested article (request: 'Introducing GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark'). Heightened scrutiny applied to factual accuracy, framing bias, source independence, and completeness.",
    "content_quality": "Excellent technical reporting with clear structure. Well-organized sections covering the model, infrastructure changes, Cerebras partnership, unknowns, and analysis. Appropriate depth for a News article at 781 words.",
    "source_verification": "7 sources cited including 2 primary sources (OpenAI blog, Cerebras blog), TechCrunch, and 4 secondary tech outlets. Five sources not on the allowlist but all are legitimate: cerebras.ai is a primary company source, simonwillison.net is a well-known developer/analyst blog, and techzine.eu/helpnetsecurity.com/dataconomy.com are established tech publications. Source diversity is adequate — article draws from primary announcements, independent journalism, and developer commentary.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Most claims verified accurately against primary and secondary sources. Two minor issues: (1) Terminal-Bench 2.0 scores attributed to Techzine, but Techzine appears to have the Codex-Spark and full Codex scores reversed (attributing 77.3% to Codex-Spark). The article's numbers (GPT-5.3-Codex = 77.3%, Codex-Spark = 58.4%) are correct per The Decoder and OpenAI's data — the source attribution is just imprecise. (2) Cerebras Llama 3.1 70B speed stated as '2,000 tokens per second' but the Cerebras blog says 2,100 tokens/second. Minor rounding.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and balanced. The article does not uncritically promote OpenAI/Cerebras claims — it clearly notes trade-offs (Terminal-Bench performance gap), unknowns (pricing, safety evaluations, model size), and positions the Cerebras partnership as complementary rather than replacement. The Analysis section provides informed perspective without editorializing.",
    "framing_bias_check": "No framing bias detected despite human request. The article acknowledges limitations (58.4% vs 77.3% Terminal-Bench gap, no pricing, no safety details) rather than presenting a purely positive narrative. The 'What We Don't Know' section is substantive.",
    "originality": "Distinct from existing Feb 6 article covering GPT-5.3-Codex launch. This covers the Codex-Spark variant (different model), Cerebras hardware (different infrastructure), and Feb 12 announcement (different event). Not a duplicate.",
    "concerns": [
      "Terminal-Bench 2.0 scores attributed to Techzine, but Techzine appears to have the numbers reversed — article data is correct but source attribution is imprecise",
      "Cerebras Llama 3.1 70B speed rounded from 2,100 to 2,000 tokens/sec",
      "5 of 7 sources not on allowlist (all legitimate but should be considered for addition)"
    ],
    "recommendations": [],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality human-requested article that passes heightened scrutiny. Balanced coverage with proper acknowledgment of limitations. Two minor factual issues (Techzine score attribution, Cerebras Llama rounding) are not blocking — the core facts are correct. APPROVE."
