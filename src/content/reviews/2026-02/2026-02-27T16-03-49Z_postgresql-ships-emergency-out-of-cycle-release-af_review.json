    "summary": "PostgreSQL 18.3, 17.9, 16.13, 15.17, and 14.22 fix regressions introduced when patching five CVEs, including a broken substring() function on non-ASCII text and standby servers halting mid-replication.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nThe PostgreSQL Global Development Group has released an [emergency out-of-cycle update](https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/postgresql-183-179-1613-1517-and-1422-released-3246/) covering all five supported version branches -- 18.3, 17.9, 16.13, 15.17, and 14.22 -- to fix regressions introduced just two weeks earlier when the project shipped patches for five security vulnerabilities, three of which carried CVSS scores of 8.8. The February 26 release addresses broken multi-byte text...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Excellent technical depth and clarity. The article is well-structured with logical flow: background on the February 12 security release, specific regression details, the February 26 emergency fix, and broader implications. The 'What We Don't Know' section demonstrates editorial honesty. Word count of 906 is appropriate for the News category (400-1200 range).",
    "source_verification": "All 6 sources verified directly against postgresql.org. While postgresql.org and wiki.postgresql.org are not yet in the source allowlist, they are the official authoritative primary sources for PostgreSQL releases, CVE advisories, and community documentation. The allowlist warning is a gap in the allowlist configuration, not a source quality concern. All source URLs were confirmed reachable and their content accurately matches the article's claims.",
    "factual_accuracy": "All factual claims verified against the cited primary sources: (1) The five CVE numbers and CVSS scores (8.8, 8.8, 8.8, 8.2, 4.3) are confirmed correct. (2) The February 12 and February 26 release dates are accurate. (3) The specific regression behaviors (substring() raising 'invalid byte sequence for encoding' on non-ASCII column values, standby halt error message, pg_trgm strict_word_similarity crash) match the official announcements precisely. (4) The list of additional fixes in the February 26 release (json_strip_nulls() volatility, LATERAL UNION ALL, NOT NULL constraint naming, hstore binary input, PL/pgSQL casting) all verified. (5) The catalog update requirement for users upgrading from 18.0-18.2 is confirmed.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. No sensationalism despite the 'emergency' nature of the release. The analysis section contextualizes the event without editorializing. No AI self-reference.",
    "originality": "No existing PostgreSQL articles in the archive cover this story. The only PostgreSQL-related article (MySQL governance crisis) is a different topic entirely. This is a genuinely new, timely story.",
    "concerns": [],
    "recommendations": [
      "postgresql.org and wiki.postgresql.org should be added to config/source_allowlist.txt as they are authoritative primary sources for PostgreSQL project news and documentation."
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality, technically accurate submission. All claims trace directly to official PostgreSQL project sources. The article covers a significant real-world incident (emergency out-of-cycle database release) with appropriate depth, factual precision, and neutral tone. Approved for publication."
