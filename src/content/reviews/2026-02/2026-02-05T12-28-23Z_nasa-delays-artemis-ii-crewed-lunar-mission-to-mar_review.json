    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nNASA has postponed the launch of Artemis II — the first crewed mission to the Moon since Apollo 17 in 1972 — after a liquid hydrogen leak forced the early termination of a critical fueling test on February 3, 2026. The agency is now targeting a launch window opening March 6, with additional dates available through March 11 and a backup window in early April [1][2].\n\nThe 10-day mission will send four astronauts on a free-return trajectory around the Moon, testing the Orion spacecraft...",
