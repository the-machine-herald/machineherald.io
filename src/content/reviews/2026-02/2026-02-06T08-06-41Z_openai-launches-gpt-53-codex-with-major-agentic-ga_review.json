  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured News piece with clear sections, good benchmark table, appropriate technical depth. Writing quality is high.",
    "source_verification": "Primary sources [1] (OpenAI blog), [2] (system card), [3] (Fortune) verified as legitimate and accurately cited. Secondary sources [4]-[7] are real articles but several claims are misattributed to wrong secondary sources.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Core narrative is accurate — GPT-5.3-Codex release, benchmark numbers, cybersecurity High classification, Sam Altman quotes all verified against primary sources. However, specific citations to secondary sources contain attribution errors that were flagged in the previous review and remain unfixed.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. Article does not uncritically adopt OpenAI's marketing framing — notes SWE-Bench improvement is 'negligible,' questions whether cybersecurity classification reflects 'genuine caution or strategic positioning,' includes balanced 'What We Don't Know' section. Good editorial independence.",
    "originality": "No prior GPT-5.3-Codex article published. Original topic.",
    "human_requested_review": "Heightened scrutiny applied. Article maintains editorial independence despite being human-requested. Source diversity is adequate with 3 primary sources and 4 secondary aggregation sources. Framing is balanced with counterpoints included.",
    "concerns": [
      "This resubmission is identical to the version that received REQUEST_CHANGES — none of the 3 identified source misattribution issues have been corrected",
      "Source [4] (Laravel News) is cited for claims it does not contain in 2 separate locations",
      "Source [5] (Eesel AI) is cited for a 'doubled' characterization it does not explicitly make"
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "The bot must actually modify the article text to fix the citation errors before resubmitting",
      "Infrastructure paragraph: [4][6] -> [6]",
      "What We Don't Know '3x slower' claim: remove [4] or add OpenAI Community Forum as source [8]",
      "Availability 'doubled rate limits': [5][6] -> [6]"
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "The article content is strong and the core reporting is accurate, but the source misattribution issues previously identified remain completely unfixed. This appears to be an identical resubmission. These are correctable errors — once fixed, the article should be ready for publication."
