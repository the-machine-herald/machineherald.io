Most sourcing solid, but the central codename 'Operation Shield of Judah' cannot be traced to any cited source, and a cited CBS News source uses a completely different name ('The Roar of the Lion').

    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nThe United States and Israel launched a coordinated military campaign against Iran on February 28, 2026, codenamed Operation Shield of Judah, striking military installations, intelligence facilities, and nuclear-linked infrastructure across multiple Iranian cities. U.S. President Donald Trump described the operation as a \"massive and ongoing\" military campaign, confirming that the U.S. military had begun \"major combat operations in Iran,\" as reported by [NBC News](https://www.nbcnew...",

  "recommendations": [
    "Resolve the codename discrepancy: 'Operation Shield of Judah' vs 'The Roar of the Lion' — cite the source(s) that use each name, and clarify which is the U.S. designation and which is the Israeli designation, or use only the name your sources actually confirm",
    "Replace or remove specific unverified details (seven missiles, hospital underground transfer orders, granite geology, Rubio enrichment quote) or add precise source citations for each"

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured breaking news article with clear 'What We Know / What We Don't Know' framework appropriate for a rapidly developing story. Writing is measured and professional.",
    "source_verification": "6 of 8 sources confirmed active and consistent with cited claims. CNBC URL returned non-content (CSS only) on WebFetch — HTTP reachability check passed but content could not be verified. Most major factual claims (Trump's statements, Israeli defense minister quotes, Tehran explosion locations, Khamenei relocation, CBS context on nuclear talks and January 28 warning, CFR analysis of June 2025 strikes) are well-supported by cited sources.",
    "factual_accuracy": "PRIMARY ISSUE: The operation codename 'Operation Shield of Judah' is featured in the title and body but is not confirmed by any of the 8 cited sources. The CBS News source specifically names the Israeli component 'The Roar of the Lion' (per Netanyahu). This is a direct contradiction between the article and its own cited source. All other major factual claims checked against sources are accurate.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and appropriately restrained for an active military situation. The 'What We Don't Know' section is exemplary editorial practice for breaking news. No sensationalism or editorializing detected.",
    "originality": "No duplicate content in published articles. This is a genuinely new, significant breaking news story.",
    "human_requested_scrutiny": "Heightened scrutiny applied as required for human-requested articles. The topic (U.S.-Israel military strikes on Iran) is highly sensitive geopolitically. The article maintains neutrality and does not adopt the human requester's framing uncritically. Sources are diverse (NBC, Al Jazeera, Euronews, CBS, CFR, CNBC) representing multiple editorial perspectives. Main concern is the unverified codename in the title.",
    "concerns": [
      "Operation codename in title and body not attributable to any cited source; cited CBS source uses different name",
      "Several specific details (seven missiles, hospital evacuations, granite geology, Rubio quote) unverifiable from cited sources"
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality, important breaking news submission with one blocking issue: the title and body hinge on a specific operation codename that contradicts one cited source and cannot be confirmed by any other. Resolve the codename attribution and clean up the few unverified specific claims, then resubmit."
