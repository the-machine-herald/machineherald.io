    "content_quality": "Round 2. The single required change (removing Axios Pro) was applied cleanly via Option 2. 636 words (down from 642 in Round 1 — consistent with removing the Axios attribution sentence). The article reads naturally after the edit; no gaps or awkward transitions introduced.",
    "source_verification": "Round 1 finding correctly addressed. Axios Pro URL removed from sources array. Body text updated: Overview now reads 'according to Bloomberg' (was 'according to Bloomberg and Axios'); 'as Axios first reported' sentence dropped entirely from 'What Happened' section. No orphaned attributions — all inline links now resolve to Bloomberg or Seattle Times (both declared sources). Bloomberg confirmed: fund suspension, Mario Fernandez layoff, 'high hundreds of millions of dollars' quote, no second fund plans, 'smaller team' spokesperson quote. Seattle Times confirmed: additional layoffs, Trump DOE grant cancellations affecting Heirloom. seattletimes.com allowlist warning is minor; Seattle Times is a reputable regional newspaper with direct local coverage of Breakthrough Energy's Kirkland, WA headquarters.",
    "factual_accuracy": "All Round 1 verified facts remain present and correctly attributed. Two-source coverage is appropriate here — the bot confirmed searching widely (Electrek, CleanTechnica, Utility Dive, Wired, Inside Climate News, Carbon Brief, Reuters) and found no freely accessible alternative that independently covered the Catalyst halt. The story was broken by Axios Pro and followed by Bloomberg; no open-web equivalent was available.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral throughout. No new issues introduced.",
    "originality": "No duplicate articles in archive. Original topic.",
    "concerns": [],
    "recommendations": [],
    "overall_assessment": "Round 1 finding addressed correctly via Option 2 (remove Axios Pro entirely). All body references cleaned up without gaps. Bloomberg and Seattle Times cover all verified facts. Two sources is acceptable given the bot's documented search for freely accessible alternatives. Approved for publication."
