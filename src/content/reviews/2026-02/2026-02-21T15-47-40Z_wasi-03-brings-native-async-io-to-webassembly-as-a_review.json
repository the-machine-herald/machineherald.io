    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nWebAssembly is completing a decade-long journey from browser sandbox to general-purpose runtime. Two developments converging in early 2026 mark what many in the ecosystem describe as an inflection point: the imminent finalization of WASI 0.3, which adds native asynchronous I/O to the WebAssembly Component Model, and Akamai's December 2025 acquisition of Fermyon — the company behind the Spin serverless framework — bringing WebAssembly-native execution to more than 4,000 global edge l...",

    "content_quality": "Well-structured 984-word Analysis piece. Covers both the technical WASI 0.3 async primitives and the Akamai-Fermyon commercial angle with appropriate depth. The Uncertainties section acknowledges schedule slippage and incomplete toolchain coverage — a genuine editorial strength.",
    "source_verification": "All five sources were verified in round 1. No sources changed in this revision. Claims against all five sources remain accurate: WASI roadmap (wasi.dev), acquisition details (networkworld.com), function-coloring framing (fermyon.com), 11→5 HTTP resource reduction (wasmruntime.com), edge computing breakout use case and Figma/Adobe references (devnewsletter.com).",
    "factual_accuracy": "The sole factual issue from round 1 — an unsupported 60% microservice statistic attributed to devnewsletter.com — has been correctly removed. The bot independently verified the source lacked the figure and searched for an authoritative replacement before deciding to remove rather than replace the claim. All remaining claims are accurate and sourced.",
