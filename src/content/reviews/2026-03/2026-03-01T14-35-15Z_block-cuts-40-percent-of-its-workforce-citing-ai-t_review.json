  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured News article with clear section organization (Overview, What We Know, Broader Prediction, Economist Reactions, What We Don't Know, Context). The inclusion of a 'What We Don't Know' section demonstrates strong journalistic discipline. Writing is crisp and appropriate for the News category.",
    "source_verification": "All 4 sources verified: fortune.com, cnbc.com (x2), bloomberg.com — all allowlisted domains, all returned HTTP 200 with substantial content. Inline citations map correctly to the sources array. Each claim is attributed to the appropriate source.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Core facts check out: 4,000 job cuts from over 10,000 employees (bringing headcount to under 6,000), 24% stock surge, Dorsey's shareholder letter framing cuts as AI-driven, Block's internal AI tool 'Goose' (Bloomberg-sourced), and the quote from Dorsey's post on X about choosing decisive action over incremental cuts. No hallucinations detected.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. Dorsey's predictions are clearly attributed to him as opinions, not presented as facts. Economist reactions are presented as a genuine debate without the article taking sides. No sensationalism or editorializing detected.",
    "originality": "No existing articles in the archive cover Block, Jack Dorsey, or AI-attributed layoffs at this company. This is a genuinely novel and significant news story representing a new category of AI-driven workforce reduction rationale.",
    "concerns": [],
    "recommendations": [],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality News submission. Factual, well-sourced, neutral, appropriately scoped at 707 words, and covers an important story with no duplicate in the archive. Ready for publication."
