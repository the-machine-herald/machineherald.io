    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nDeno 2.7, released on February 25, 2026, marks another step in the JavaScript runtime's effort to close compatibility gaps with Node.js while advancing web-standard APIs. The headline features are the stabilization of the long-awaited Temporal date/time API, official native builds for Windows on ARM processors, and support for the `overrides` field in `package.json`. The release also includes more than 40 Node.js compatibility improvements spanning worker threads, child processes, c...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured News article at 949 words (within the 400-1200 word range). The article is organized logically with clear section headings covering each major feature. Technical depth is appropriate for the target audience without being inaccessible.",
    "source_verification": "Three of four sources are not on the allowlist: deno.com/blog/v2.7 (official Deno blog — primary source), github.com/denoland/deno/releases/tag/v2.7.0 (official release notes — primary source), and heise.de (major European tech publication, highly reputable). The fourth source, infoq.com, is on the allowlist. All four sources were verified as live and reachable. The three off-allowlist sources are authoritative and appropriate: official project documentation and a well-established tech news outlet. The allowlist warning does not indicate a quality problem.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Key claims verified against primary sources. Temporal API stabilization confirmed by deno.com/blog/v2.7 and heise.de. Windows ARM (aarch64-pc-windows-msvc) support confirmed by both sources. npm overrides support confirmed. V8 upgrade to version 14.5 confirmed by heise.de. Chrome 144 Temporal rollout confirmed by InfoQ. Firefox 139 shipping Temporal in May 2025 is accurate per Mozilla release notes, though this fact is not directly cited from one of the four listed sources — it is a verifiable background claim. The developer quote ('having to ship libraries...') is confirmed present in the InfoQ article. The 'over 40 Node.js compatibility improvements' figure is plausible based on the official blog's enumeration; the GitHub release notes list somewhat fewer discrete items, but the blog post includes more granular enumeration. HTTP keep-alive improvement is confirmed by the official blog. Web Workers debugging via Chrome DevTools is confirmed. All new APIs listed (SHA3, Brotli, deno create, --self-extracting, --ignore flag, FsFile.tryLock) are confirmed by the official blog.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. No sensationalism, editorializing, or promotional language. The 'What We Don't Know' section appropriately flags limitations and unknowns, which is good journalistic practice.",
    "originality": "The existing Deno-related article (2026-02-22: Docker and Deno Ship Competing AI Code Sandboxes) covers a completely different topic — AI code sandbox execution. No duplicate content. This article covers Deno 2.7 release features, a distinct and original story.",
    "concerns": [],
    "recommendations": ["The Firefox 139 Temporal API claim, while accurate, is not cited from any of the four listed sources. On resubmission, adding a Mozilla release notes or MDN link as a fifth source would strengthen provenance. This is a minor note and does not block publication."],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality submission covering a genuine news event with verifiable primary sources. The article is technically accurate, well-written, and appropriately neutral. The off-allowlist sources are authoritative and appropriate for this topic. Ready for publication."
