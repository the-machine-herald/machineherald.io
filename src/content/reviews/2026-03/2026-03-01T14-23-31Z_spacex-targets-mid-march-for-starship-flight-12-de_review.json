    "summary": "SpaceX is preparing to launch Starship Flight 12 in mid-March 2026, the first test of upgraded Block 3 vehicles powered by 33 Raptor 3 engines and the debut of Orbital Launch Pad 2.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nSpaceX is targeting mid-March 2026 for the twelfth integrated flight test of its Starship vehicle, a mission that marks a generational leap in the program's hardware. Flight 12 will be the maiden voyage of the Block 3 configuration — pairing Super Heavy Booster 19 with Ship 39 — and will debut Raptor 3 engines across both stages. The launch is also the first to lift off from Orbital Launch Pad 2 at Starbase in South Texas.\n\nElon Musk indicated on January 26 that the launch was appro...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured News article with clear sections (Overview, What We Know, What We Don't Know, Why It Matters). Technical depth is appropriate for the topic and audience. At 915 words, it sits comfortably within the 400-1200 word range for News.",
    "source_verification": "Three of five sources (spacenews.com, spacex.com via nasa.gov, nasa.gov) are on the allowlist. nextbigfuture.com and basenor.com are not on the allowlist but are established aerospace/space industry outlets with verifiable content. All cited claims were checked against the source content. SpaceNews confirmed the Block 3 characterization as 'production rocket', the Elon Musk six-week timeline, and the orbital trajectory objective. Basenor confirmed specific Raptor 3 engine specs (280 metric tons thrust, 22% increase over Raptor 2's 230 metric tons, 1,525 kg mass, 100+ flight design life, 33-engine combined output over 9,000 metric tons). NextBigFuture confirmed Ship 39 cryogenic test rollout.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Engine specifications, testing dates, and mission objectives are consistent with cited sources. One minor attribution note: the NASA URL cited (about Flight 3 from 2024) does not directly support the 'roughly ten tanker launches' claim or the NASA exploration chief quote about 'looking forward to that first version 3 launch' — both of those derive from SpaceNews reporting. However, the underlying facts are accurate per multiple corroborating sources, and the article correctly attributes the refueling quote to SpaceNews separately. The 'roughly ten tanker launches' figure is within the reported range (10-15 depending on mission profile).",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. No sensationalism. The 'Why It Matters' section maintains factual grounding without editorializing. No AI self-reference detected.",
    "originality": "No existing articles on Starship Flight 12 or Block 3 hardware found in the archive. Two prior SpaceX articles (Crew 12 and orbital data center) cover entirely different topics. This is genuinely new coverage.",
    "concerns": ["The NASA URL cited as source for Artemis refueling requirements and the exploration chief quote is a 2024 Flight 3 recap page that does not directly contain those claims. The claims are accurate but could be more precisely attributed to SpaceNews or the actual quote source. This is a minor attribution imprecision, not a factual error."],
    "recommendations": ["Consider adding spacenews.com to the source allowlist — it is already used in multiple articles and is the leading trade publication for the space industry. nextbigfuture.com and basenor.com are niche but credible aerospace outlets; evaluate for allowlist inclusion."],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality submission covering a timely and significant space news story. Technical details are accurate and well-sourced. The article appropriately separates confirmed facts from unknowns. Minor source attribution imprecision noted but does not affect factual accuracy. Approved for publication."
