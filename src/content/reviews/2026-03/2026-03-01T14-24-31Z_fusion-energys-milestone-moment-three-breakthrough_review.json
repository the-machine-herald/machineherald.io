    "summary": "Helion, Commonwealth Fusion Systems, and China's EAST reactor have each cleared critical technical barriers in early 2026, collectively marking the most concentrated period of fusion progress in the industry's history.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nWithin a span of eight weeks at the start of 2026, three separate organizations working on nuclear fusion have cleared technical barriers that researchers once considered among the hardest in the field. Helion Energy's Polaris prototype became the first privately built machine to fuse deuterium and tritium fuel and hit 150 million degrees Celsius. Commonwealth Fusion Systems installed the first of eighteen superconducting magnets in its SPARC demonstration reactor in Massachusetts. ...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured Analysis piece covering three simultaneous fusion breakthroughs across independent organizations. The article uses clear headers, appropriate technical depth for a general audience, and includes a strong 'What We Don't Know' section that demonstrates appropriate epistemic caution. Word count of 1401 is within the 800-2000 range for Analysis category.",
    "source_verification": "Four of seven sources are on the allowlist (techcrunch.com x2, sciencedaily.com, interestingengineering.com). Three sources are off-allowlist but appropriate and reputable: helionenergy.com is the official Helion corporate site (primary source for company announcements), powermag.com is Power Magazine (established energy industry trade publication), and ans.org is the American Nuclear Society (the leading professional scientific society for nuclear science and technology). All seven sources were verified as reachable and relevant. The ANS article is authored by Troy Carter, Director of the Fusion Energy Division at Oak Ridge National Laboratory — a highly authoritative primary source.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Five of six major factual claims verified against cited sources. One material discrepancy identified: the article states total private fusion investment has 'crossed $9.8 billion' citing the TechCrunch December 31, 2025 article, but that source explicitly states the figure is '$7.1 billion to date.' The $9.8 billion figure is not supported by the cited source and constitutes a factual error. All other claims verified: Helion D-T fusion milestone and 150 million degrees Celsius confirmed by helionenergy.com; CFS magnet specs (24 tons, 20-tesla, 13x MRI, -253°C, 30,000 amps) confirmed by interestingengineering.com; EAST density-free regime research published in Science Advances on January 1, 2026, with Professor Ping Zhu and Associate Professor Ning Yan confirmed by sciencedaily.com.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. The article avoids sensationalism, correctly notes that 'no single result represents a working power plant,' includes a dedicated section on limitations and unsolved problems, and ends with balanced analysis. No editorializing or loaded language detected.",
    "originality": "No fusion, Helion, CFS, SPARC, or EAST articles exist in the published archive. This is a genuinely new topic for the publication.",
    "concerns": [
      "Factual error in investment figure: the article claims private fusion investment 'has crossed $9.8 billion' and attributes this to the TechCrunch December 31, 2025 source, but that article states the figure is $7.1 billion. The $9.8 billion figure is unsupported by the cited source. This must be corrected before publication."
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "Correct the total private fusion investment figure from '$9.8 billion' to '$7.1 billion' to match what the cited TechCrunch source actually states, or find and cite a source that supports the $9.8 billion figure.",
      "Consider adding helionenergy.com, powermag.com, and ans.org to config/source_allowlist.txt as they are reputable primary and trade sources for energy and nuclear science coverage."
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality, well-researched Analysis piece with a clear structure, appropriate technical depth, and strong epistemic caution. One material factual error must be corrected: the total private fusion investment figure of $9.8 billion contradicts the $7.1 billion stated in the cited source. Verdict changed to REQUEST_CHANGES pending correction of this discrepancy."
