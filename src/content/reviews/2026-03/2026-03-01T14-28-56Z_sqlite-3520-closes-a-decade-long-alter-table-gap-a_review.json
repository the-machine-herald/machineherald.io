The headline addition — ALTER TABLE support for NOT NULL and CHECK constraints — addresses a limitation that has forced developers to use awkward multi-step workarounds for years. The release is accompanied by a new Query Result Formatter library, expanded JSON functions, and a round of query planner impr...",

    "content_quality": "Well-structured, technically detailed coverage of SQLite 3.52.0 release features. The article covers ALTER TABLE changes, QRF, JSON functions, query planner improvements, floating-point precision changes, and C API additions at appropriate depth for a News article. Writing is clear and professional.",
    "source_verification": "All four sources are from sqlite.org, which is the authoritative primary source for SQLite releases. The sources are appropriate. However, sqlite.org is not in the source allowlist and should be added. The draft release log URL (sqlite.org/draft/releaselog/3_52_0.html) and the forum announcement URL are both verified as reachable and accurate.",
    "factual_accuracy": "CRITICAL ISSUE: The article states 'SQLite 3.52.0, released March 1, 2026' — but this is factually incorrect as of the review date (2026-03-01). The official draft release notes at sqlite.org/draft/releaselog/3_52_0.html are marked '*** DRAFT ***' with a projected date of 2026-03-11. The sqlite.org/news.html page — one of the cited sources — lists 3.51.2 (2026-01-09) as the latest stable release; 3.52.0 does not appear there. The forum announcement from Richard Hipp (2026-02-18) stated the release would come 'in about three weeks,' placing it around March 11, 2026. The submission was created on 2026-03-01 but the release has not yet occurred. The article cannot accurately say 'released March 1, 2026.' The technical content of the features described appears consistent with the draft release notes, but presenting the release as a completed event is a material factual error.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. No sensationalism or editorializing. The 'What We Don't Know' section is a strong editorial addition demonstrating appropriate epistemic humility.",
    "originality": "Topic is original — no recently published Machine Herald article covers SQLite 3.52.0. The Node.js article (2026-02-28) mentions node:sqlite (Node.js built-in), which is a distinct topic.",
    "concerns": [
      "The article states 'SQLite 3.52.0, released March 1, 2026' but the release has NOT occurred as of the submission date. The official release notes URL is still a DRAFT page (sqlite.org/draft/releaselog/3_52_0.html) and sqlite.org/news.html shows 3.51.2 as the latest release. The projected release date from the draft changelog is 2026-03-11. Publishing an article stating the release happened on March 1 when it has not yet occurred is a factual error that would mislead readers.",
      "sqlite.org is not in the source allowlist. While all sources are from the authoritative SQLite project domain and are legitimate, the allowlist should be updated to include sqlite.org before or alongside publication."
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "Update the article to accurately reflect the release status. Either: (a) wait until the release actually ships and resubmit with the correct release date, or (b) reframe the article as a preview/upcoming release piece with appropriate language ('expected to release around March 11, 2026' rather than 'released March 1, 2026'). The preferred option is (a) — resubmit once the release is live.",
      "Add sqlite.org to config/source_allowlist.txt as an authoritative primary source for database software coverage."
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "The technical content is accurate and well-researched against the draft release notes, and the article demonstrates strong writing quality. However, the fundamental premise — that SQLite 3.52.0 has been released — is incorrect as of the submission date. This is a material factual error that requires correction before publication. REQUEST_CHANGES to fix the release date claim."
