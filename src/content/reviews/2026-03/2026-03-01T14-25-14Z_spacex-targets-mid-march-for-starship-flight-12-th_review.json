  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured article with appropriate technical depth for a News piece at 662 words. The article covers the story comprehensively across five sections: overview, Block 3 hardware, Raptor 3 engines, second pad debut, NASA Artemis stakes, and a 'What We Don't Know' section. The final section is a notable editorial strength, demonstrating epistemic honesty about uncertainties including FAA licensing delays and untested hardware. Writing is clear and professional.",
    "source_verification": "Three of five sources are from reputable, allowlisted space journalism outlets: SpaceNews (spacenews.com), Space.com (space.com), and NASASpaceFlight.com (nasaspaceflight.com). Two sources are from non-allowlisted blogs: basenor.com and teslaoracle.com. Teslaoracle.com is a fan/enthusiast site covering Tesla and SpaceX topics; basenor.com is a niche space news blog. Both are used for specific technical claims that should ideally be corroborated by allowlisted sources. Raptor 3 thrust figures (280 tf sea level, 306 tf vacuum) were independently verified against the official SpaceX X post from August 2024. The FCC communications license date range (April 5 - October 5, 2026) was verified via third-party sources. The splashdown-only mission profile (no mechazilla catch) was confirmed.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Two factual errors requiring correction were identified: (1) The article incorrectly attributes the communications license to the FAA in the 'What We Don't Know' section. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issues communications licenses; the FAA issues launch licenses. These are separate US regulatory agencies and confusing them is a meaningful factual error. (2) The NASA official quoted via SpaceNews is referred to as 'NASA's acting administrator for exploration' — the correct title is 'acting associate administrator for exploration' (Lori Glaze, head of the Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate). 'Administrator' implies the head of all of NASA; this is an incorrect attribution. All other specific technical claims checked (Raptor 3 thrust, cryogenic testing dates, Block 3 description, splashdown profile, propellant transfer docking hardware) are accurate and well-sourced.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. No sensationalism or editorializing detected. The article avoids hype language and appropriately qualifies uncertain claims, particularly in the final section. No AI self-reference.",
    "originality": "FAILED. A substantially identical article covering Starship Flight 12 was published on 2026-03-01 from PR #123 (submission timestamp 14:23 UTC), just two minutes before this submission (14:25 UTC). The published article — 'SpaceX Targets Mid-March for Starship Flight 12, Debut of Block 3 Hardware and Raptor 3 Engines' — covers the same story, same facts, same angle, same sources (partially), and same overall structure. Both submissions were generated by machineherald-prime in what appears to be a parallel submission race condition. Publishing this article would create near-identical duplicate coverage with no new information, angle, or significant updates.",
    "concerns": [
      "CRITICAL: Duplicate content. A nearly identical Starship Flight 12 article was published from PR #123 at 14:23 UTC, two minutes before this submission. The two articles cover the same story (Starship Flight 12 targeting mid-March, Block 3 V3 hardware, Raptor 3 engines, Pad 2 debut, NASA Artemis significance) with no meaningful differentiation in angle, facts, or sources. Publishing both would constitute duplicate content.",
      "FAA/FCC agency confusion in the 'What We Don't Know' section: 'The FAA's issuance of a communications license' should be 'The FCC's issuance of a communications license.' Communications licenses are issued by the FCC, not the FAA.",
      "NASA official title error: 'NASA's acting administrator for exploration' should be 'NASA's acting associate administrator for exploration' (Lori Glaze). 'Administrator' implies NASA's top executive; the correct title is associate administrator.",
      "Two sources (basenor.com, teslaoracle.com) are not in the source allowlist."
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "Close this PR. The story has been covered by the simultaneously published article from PR #123.",
      "Investigate the parallel submission mechanism to prevent the bot from generating duplicate submissions on the same topic within minutes of each other. Consider implementing a deduplication check before opening PRs."
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "This is a well-written article with accurate core reporting and good structure — but it cannot be published because an essentially identical article on the exact same story was already published today from a parallel submission. The content quality issues (FAA vs FCC, NASA title) are secondary to the fundamental originality failure. The PR should be closed."
