    "summary": "Linus Torvalds confirms the next kernel will be 7.0, citing confusion over large numbers, as the first RC ships with one of the largest merge windows on record.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nOn February 8, 2026, Linus Torvalds announced that after Linux 6.19 the next kernel release would carry the version number 7.0, marking the first major version increment since the jump from 5.x to 6.0 in 2022. The decision was practical rather than architectural: as Torvalds explained in his announcement, he was \"getting to the point where I'm being confused by large numbers (almost running out of fingers and toes again).\" Two weeks later, on February 22, 2026, Torvalds tagged the f...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured and technically detailed News article covering Linux 7.0-rc1. The article uses clear section headers, balances breadth (version numbering, hardware enablement, Rust, filesystems, distribution impact, succession) with appropriate depth for a 1,058-word News piece. Torvalds' quoted rationale for the version bump is directly cited with the correct Register URL.",
    "source_verification": "Three of four listed sources were verified as reachable and reputable: theregister.com (×2) and tomshardware.com are on the allowlist and confirmed to cover the reported events. The fourth source (linux.slashdot.org) is a subdomain of slashdot.org, which IS on the allowlist at line 111; the automated warning is a subdomain-matching technicality rather than a legitimacy concern. The article body also references a fifth Register URL (theregister.com/2026/01/27/linux_continuity_plan/) inline in the Succession Context section — this URL is not listed in the formal sources array. That source was verified and confirms the conclave.rst document and the 72-hour convening window.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Core claims check out: version bump announcement on February 8, rc1 tagged February 22, 14,500 commits, Torvalds' 'fingers and toes' quote, Rust stabilization in this cycle, Nova Lake/Zen 6 enablement, Ubuntu 26.04/Fedora 44 as target distributions, and the conclave.rst succession document. One unverified specific: the article states 'Torvalds signed the commit himself' for the conclave.rst merge — this specific detail was not confirmed by the referenced Register article or other immediately accessible sources. The detail is plausible but not source-backed.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. The 'What We Don't Know' section is particularly good editorial practice — it honestly acknowledges open questions without speculation. The Analysis section provides context without advocacy. No sensationalism or loaded language detected.",
    "originality": "The existing Linux 6.19 article (2026-02-05) covers the pre-release phase and Rust driver development in that cycle. This submission covers Linux 7.0-rc1, a distinct release event with new developments. No duplication of content.",
    "concerns": [
      "The claim 'Torvalds signed the commit himself' for the conclave.rst document is stated as fact but is not directly supported by the cited source (theregister.com/2026/01/27/linux_continuity_plan/). The Register article only confirms the document was merged; it does not specify the committer. This is a minor unsourced specific within an otherwise well-sourced article.",
      "The Register URL for the succession plan story (theregister.com/2026/01/27/linux_continuity_plan/) is referenced inline in the article body but is not listed in the formal sources array. Future submissions should include all referenced URLs in the sources array for complete provenance."
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "In future submissions, add any inline-cited URLs to the formal sources array so that all claims have traceable provenance entries.",
      "The 'Torvalds signed the commit himself' detail should either be removed or supported by a direct link to the kernel git commit."
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality News submission covering a significant Linux kernel milestone with technically accurate reporting, well-sourced primary claims, appropriate neutral tone, and clear structure. The two concerns are minor and do not materially affect the article's reliability. Approved for publication."
