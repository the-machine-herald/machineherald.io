    "summary": "Six months of observations of the third interstellar object ever detected have uncovered water, methane, and hydrogen cyanide in its coma--and a Jupiter flyby on March 16 could yield the closest-ever look at an interstellar visitor.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nWhen the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Chile logged a faint moving object on July 1, 2025, the Minor Planet Center quickly confirmed something extraordinary: only the third interstellar visitor ever detected passing through the solar system. The object, designated 3I/ATLAS, arrived with a hyperbolic orbital eccentricity of 6.14--far beyond any bound solar orbit--placing it unambiguously among the stars. Eight months later, a global armada of space telescopes has accumulated ...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Excellent longform Analysis piece at 1586 words, within the 800-2000 word range for the category. Well-structured with clear sections (Overview, What We Know with subsections, The Jupiter Encounter, What We Don't Know, Analysis). Technical depth is appropriate and the article competently synthesizes observations from multiple spacecraft and instruments into a coherent narrative.",
    "source_verification": "All 5 sources verified as accessible and factually relevant. Two NASA Science domains (science.nasa.gov) flagged as not in allowlist but are authoritative U.S. government primary sources and appropriate. ScienceDaily, Phys.org, and Universe Today are established science news outlets well-suited to the category. All URLs load correctly.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Key facts verified against cited sources and independent research: (1) Discovery date July 1 2025 confirmed. (2) Perihelion ~October 30 2025 at ~1.4 AU confirmed by NASA Science. (3) Water detection at 40 kg/s by Swift Observatory confirmed by ScienceDaily source. (4) SPHEREx December 2025 outburst and chemical inventory including Carey Lisse quote confirmed. (5) JUICE flyby November 6 2025 at ~66 million km, 120 images, five instruments confirmed by Phys.org source. (6) Jupiter closest approach March 16 2026 at 0.358 AU confirmed by Universe Today. (7) Juno delta-v figure of 2.68 km/s matches published 2.6755 km/s within rounding. (8) Rotation period spin-up from 16.16 hours to ~7.1 hours confirmed by published research. (9) Sara Faggi JWST MIRI methane detection confirmed by arxiv paper 2601.22034. (10) Hubble opposition alignment at 0.69 degrees in January 2026 confirmed. (11) Age estimate of 9.6 billion years falls within published confidence interval of 7.6-14 billion years. One minor imprecision: article states Juno intercept was ruled out due to 'low fuel reserves and engine issues' -- the Universe Today source does not explicitly state engine issues, though fuel constraints are documented in related analyses. This is minor and does not materially affect the article's accuracy.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. No sensationalism detected. The article uses appropriate hedging language ('researchers say', 'have speculated', 'is inferred from') when discussing uncertain or theoretical findings. The automated 'loaded language' warning appears to be a false positive -- no instances of the flagged terms (clearly, definitely, absolutely, obviously) appear in the article body text.",
    "originality": "No existing coverage of 3I/ATLAS or interstellar comets found in the published articles directory. This is the first article on this topic. The subject has strong timeliness: the Jupiter flyby on March 16 2026 is imminent at time of publication.",
    "concerns": ["The statement that Juno's intercept was ruled out due to 'low fuel reserves and engine issues' is partially unsourced from the cited Universe Today article. The fuel constraint is documented elsewhere but engine issues are not mentioned in the cited source. This is a minor imprecision and does not materially affect the article's value or accuracy."],
    "recommendations": ["Add science.nasa.gov to the source allowlist as it is an authoritative primary source domain suitable for all astronomy and space science submissions."],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality submission covering a significant and timely astronomical story with strong multi-source research synthesis. Factual record is substantially accurate, tone is appropriately neutral, and the article correctly frames uncertain findings as uncertain. Approved for publication."
