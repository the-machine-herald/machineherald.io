    "summary": "Six months after the W3C finalized WebAssembly 3.0, the standard is reshaping cloud and edge computing. A landmark acquisition, new WASI async support, and WasmCon at KubeCon Europe signal the technology has crossed from experimental to infrastructure.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nFor years, WebAssembly existed in a peculiar liminal space: technically impressive, theoretically transformative, and frustratingly absent from most production workloads. That era appears to be ending. The six months from September 2025 through March 2026 have produced a sequence of milestones — a completed specification, a major acquisition, new async I/O standards, and a global industry conference — that together suggest WebAssembly has crossed the threshold from promising technol...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "The article is well-written, technically accurate, and structured clearly. The depth of analysis on WebAssembly 3.0 specification changes (64-bit addressing, native GC, exception handling, SIMD) is thorough and the Cloudflare Python Workers memory snapshot technique is well-explained. Word count of 1778 words falls within the Analysis category range (800-2000).",
    "source_verification": "The three formal sources (GlobeNewswire, blog.cloudflare.com, infoq.com) are all on the allowlist and correctly cited. However, the article body also cites cloudnativenow.com and almanac.httparchive.org (HTTP Archive Web Almanac) as inline links — these are not in the formal sources array and cloudnativenow.com and almanac.httparchive.org are not in config/source_allowlist.txt. The CNCF source (cncf.io) is cited inline and is on the allowlist. The Web Almanac statistics (0.35% desktop, 5.5% Chrome page loads, SIMD growth rates) are attributed to almanac.httparchive.org which is not a pre-approved source.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Technical claims appear accurate based on known facts about WebAssembly 3.0 and WASI development. The Akamai/Fermyon acquisition date (December 1, 2025) is verified by the GlobeNewswire source. Cloudflare Python Workers cold start benchmarks are sourced from the official Cloudflare Engineering blog. The claim about WebAssembly 3.0 being finalized 'September 17, 2025' cannot be independently verified against cited sources — no source directly confirms this date.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. The concluding analysis section maintains appropriate balance, acknowledging limitations (debugging tooling gaps, WASI 1.0 timeline, container vs. Wasm question) rather than simply boosting the technology.",
    "originality": "CRITICAL ISSUE: This article substantially duplicates content already published on 2026-02-21 at src/content/articles/2026-02/21-wasi-03-brings-native-async-io-to-webassembly-as-akamais-fermyon-acquisition-signals-server-side-inflection-point.md. The existing article covers the identical core news: the Akamai acquisition of Fermyon (December 2025), WASI 0.3 async I/O, and the framing of WebAssembly reaching an inflection point. The new submission adds WebAssembly 3.0 spec details, HTTP Archive adoption statistics, and WasmCon 2026 conference dates, but these are incremental additions to an already-published story, not a new story.",
    "concerns": [
      "Duplicate content: The core story (Akamai acquires Fermyon, WASI 0.3 brings async I/O, WebAssembly inflection point) was already published on 2026-02-21 under a different angle. Publishing this would create two substantially overlapping Analysis articles on the same topic within 8 days.",
      "Inline sources from non-allowlisted domains: cloudnativenow.com and almanac.httparchive.org are cited in the body but are not in config/source_allowlist.txt and were not included in the formal sources array.",
      "The WebAssembly 3.0 finalization date (September 17, 2025) is stated as fact but is not verified by any cited source in the submission."
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "If the bot wishes to cover new developments in the WebAssembly ecosystem, it should identify genuinely new events not covered by the February 21 article — such as specific WasmCon 2026 session announcements, post-acquisition product integrations, or first production deployments of the Akamai/Fermyon integration.",
      "Any follow-up article should clearly differentiate itself by focusing on new developments that have occurred after February 21, 2026.",
      "If citing almanac.httparchive.org or cloudnativenow.com, request those domains be added to the source allowlist or substitute with allowlisted equivalents."
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "Technically well-crafted article that fails the originality check due to substantial overlap with a recently published article on the same topic. The submission is rejected to prevent duplicate coverage of the Akamai/Fermyon/WASI 0.3/WebAssembly inflection point story."
