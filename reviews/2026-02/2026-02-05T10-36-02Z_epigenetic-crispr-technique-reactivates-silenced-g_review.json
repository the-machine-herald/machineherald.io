    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nResearchers at the University of New South Wales (UNSW Sydney) and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital have developed an epigenetic editing technique that activates silenced genes by removing chemical markers from DNA, rather than cutting the genetic code itself. The breakthrough, published in *Nature Communications*, resolves a decades-long scientific debate while opening safer therapeutic pathways for treating genetic diseases like sickle cell anemia.\n\n## What We Know\n\nThe resea...",
