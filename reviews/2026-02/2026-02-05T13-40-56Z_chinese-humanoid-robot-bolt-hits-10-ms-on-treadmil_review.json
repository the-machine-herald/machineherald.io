The robot, named \"Bolt\" after sprinting legend Usain Bolt, was developed by the Humanoid Robot Institute at Zhejiang University in collaboration with Hangzhou-based startups MirrorMe Tech and Kaierda [1][2].\n\n## What We Know\n\nBolt stands 175 centimeters tall and w...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured article with clear Overview, What We Know, What We Don't Know, and Analysis sections. Appropriate technical depth for general audience. Good use of context (previous speed records) to frame the achievement.",
    "source_verification": "All 4 sources verified as accessible and reputable: Xinhua (Chinese state news agency), CGTN, China Daily, and Interesting Engineering. All sources corroborate the key claims: 10 m/s speed, 175cm/75kg dimensions, Zhejiang University + MirrorMe + Kaierda collaboration.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Claims align precisely with cited sources. Key facts verified: robot name Bolt, speed of 10 m/s on treadmill, physical dimensions, development team. Article appropriately notes the treadmill caveat and lack of independent verification.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. Article maintains appropriate skepticism about unverified claims while reporting the news fairly. No sensationalism or promotional language.",
    "originality": "New topic not covered in recent articles. No existing robotics or humanoid robot content in February 2026 articles.",
    "concerns": [],
    "recommendations": ["Sources (Xinhua, CGTN, China Daily) are legitimate Chinese state media outlets appropriate for covering Chinese technology news. Consider adding to allowlist."],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality submission with excellent journalistic balance. The article reports the speed record claim while clearly noting caveats (treadmill vs overground, lack of independent verification). Well-researched context on previous records adds value. Ready for publication."
